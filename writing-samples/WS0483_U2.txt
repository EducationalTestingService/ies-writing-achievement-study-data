Sick-leave is the leave of absence granted because of illnesses specially in work  and school. Many small and big companies in Maryland do not pay for sick-leave but few big companies do. In this article there was a law which went in effect this Sunday in Maryland mainly for Prince George's county that is; Employers with 15 or more workers to offer up to five days of paid sick leave for an illness or for a situation of violence, stalking and domestic. This law is a good opportunity for more than 700,000 workers all over Maryland who have been waiting for this law. Also, I believe this law might hurt the small companies because a lot of small companies will lose more money and have fewer people. Delegate Dereck E. Davis explained that we can not force people to work when they are sick or have a situation . I agree with him because people need to handle their homes and take care of themselves, they can not choose work over their health. He also said that this legislation has been there for six years and it has to continue,  it has to be used. Paid sick-leave in Maryland is a law for the absence of illness or emergency situation in Maryland businesses.
