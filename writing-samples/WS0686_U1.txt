	As a devout Christian, faith is not an absence of thought. As a Christian, one must follow all the teachings found within the Bible rigidly to follow their faith in God. In order to follow the scriptures as accurately as possible, one must constantly remind themselves of all of the expectations God has set for us. Though one cannot see God in this worldly realm, there is proof of God’s existence in nature. By observing nature as well as man’s interaction with nature, we can find proof of God’s existence. Not everything can be explained with words. Faith is primarily a feeling and a conviction of thought.



Scenario 2: Enlightenment View

	As a person in the Enlightenment era, it is easy to say that the concept of faith is an absence of thought. Faith is characteristically closer to a moral or ideal rather than a physical manifestation. To claim to have faith is to deny the necessity of physical proof. In order to deny a fact, one must set aside honest thought in order to retain their idea of faith. One cannot prove God’s existence with science. Instead, it is only through thoughts and feelings that one can claim the existence of a God. Thoughts and feelings, alone, are not proof of anything more than ideals and morals.
