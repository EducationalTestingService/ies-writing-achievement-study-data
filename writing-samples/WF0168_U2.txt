Facebook Is Using You

	Lori Andrews purpose for writing this article is to inform readers of the invasion of privacy by the government. Social media websites such as Facebook or web searching machines such as google takes what people post or what they browse online as permission to send unnecessary ads that basically harasses people. Therefore, social media is harmful to one’s identity because social media and web searching machines invade in people’s profiles, track their google searches and keep track of their financial states.

	Based on the article, “Facebook is using you”, Facebook has filed a couple documents allowing the government to sell shares of stock to the users of their website. This is basically the start of how social media gives access to our profiles to advertisers. Based on the information obtained in your search browsers or on your profiles, advertisers “lock you in” as their personal prisoner to ads. Things such as your relationship status, what city you live in or even your favorite hobbies all play a big part in why certain advertisers chastise you the most. At the end of the day the promoters always end up with what they wanted in the first place, money. In the article, “Facebook made $3.2 billion in advertising revenue last year, 85 percent of its total revenue…. Google took in more than 10 times as much, with an estimated $36.5 billion in advertising revenue in 2011…”. At the end of the day these advertisers are using your personal data to make a revenue.
	This issue to me seems to be categorizing people based on their use of the internet. Just because someone lives in a certain neighborhood or because they search a certain sickness doesn’t mean they should be bombarded with a bunch of ads. It’s an invasion of privacy, and should at least be given permission first. In this case, I believe that laws are necessary, it’s the only way to make the people feel safe and secure when using the internet period.
