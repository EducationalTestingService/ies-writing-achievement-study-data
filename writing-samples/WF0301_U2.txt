I would like to thank you for the opportunity to apply for this marketing internship role at Surgical Associates P.A. I am confidant that with my skills and previous job experience that I can take on this job exceeding your expectations.

I am a dedicated college student (B.S. Business Administration, Marketing Strategy) currently attending the University. In my spare time apart from school I work at Banana Republic as a Sales Associate where my professional skills have grown in several ways, mostly by learning about customer loyalty and direct sales methods. I have been admired for my dedication and persistence by co-workers and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or work projects, I have consistently proven my abilities such as critical thinking, leadership, and teamwork skills, which I hope to apply to the marketing internship role. 

I appreciate the opportunity and consideration for this internship. With the skill set that I have acquired from my previous work and the business courses I have taken I am ready to learn and immerse myself in the business world. I hope you see the potential positive impact I can have on your organization after evaluating my resume. Please contact me at (555)-555-5555 or via email sd@uni.edu at a time that works for you.


Sincerely,

Sam Doe
