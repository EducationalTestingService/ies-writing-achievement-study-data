Compare and Contrast Assignment 

	My English 101 class and Biology 102 class are similar in many ways because they both are fast paste, require a lot of thought, and require a lot of time. These classes are both fast paste, my professors use a syllabus to keep students such as myself up to date with different lessons and subjects prior to class discussions or assignments. If you’re not keeping up with the syllabus, then it’s very likely that you’ll be left behind, and that goes for both classes. Also, when completing assignments, these courses require a lot of thought. When writing a paper in English, you want it to have proper etiquette, have nice big vocabulary words, and be very supported when making claims, it’s the exact same in Biology. Even when it comes to conducting an experiment or writing a 5-page essay, you still would need to do a lot of critical thinking before doing any type of assignment. Plus, both these courses also require a lot of time, when it comes to studying or reading chapters in a textbook or in an assigned novel you must dedicate an adequate amount of time in order to succeed in these courses. Of course, there are more similarities when it comes to these two subjects but those are just a few indicating how they are similar.
