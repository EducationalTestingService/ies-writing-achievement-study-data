Hey Class!  
My name is Sam Doe and I am a sophomore from Anytown. I am concentrating in finance here at this university. One of my goals through this course is to further develop and strengthen my resume and allow it to become more detailed. After reading the syllabus I think the resume assignment will be very helpful for me in achieving my goal. My second goal for this class involves my face to face communication, I sometimes struggle with talking in front of people I am not comfortable with. The mock interview assignment I think will be very beneficial for me to practice talking to people I am unfamiliar with making me become more prepared for real interviews further down the line. It seems as though first impressions play such an important factor in interviews, that could eventually lead to a job. As for business communication skills, improving these abilities will always make a difference when it comes to the workforce. I think it is important that all students have strong communication skills not only inside business but other aspects of their lives, because of how important it is in companies and our society. Developing these skills and abilities while a student is important so once one has entered the workforce it is much easier to transition into with strong communication skills. The better of a communicator one is could lead to more trust and encouragement from an employer. The higher an employee can be trusted often results in better promotions, salaries, and maybe even jobs further along in their career. By having these defined skills of writing in a business setting might be the separating factor between two potential employees and makes the one with stronger communication skills rise to the top and win the position. I am looking forward to seeing all that this class has to offer in terms of making us better writers and using them in a business context.
