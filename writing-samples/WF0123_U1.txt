Black Men and Public Space
	
	I believe that Brent should not have to make himself “less threatening”. It is not his fault that the people around him feel scared or uncomfortable, just because he is a black male. “Women are particulary vulnerable to street violence, and young black males are drastically overrepresented among the perpetrators of that violence” (Brent Staples). You could see more crimes committed by black people on the news, so that could make someone think that most black men are criminals. Which is stereotyping, because that could make you fear every black make that ever comes around you. There are white criminals also; their crimes might now make headlines for some reason, but you can not assume someone is bad just by their skin color. 
	For somone to have to change the way they do things in their everyday life is not okay. “I whistle melodies from Beethoven and Vivaldi and the more popular classical composers”-Brent Staples. If someone was white walking down the street surrounded by people of a different race; I am pretty sure they would not start singing songs that they can relate to. Personally, I feel as though that people should treat others how they want to be treated, and do not judge others because they are different than you. If people in the world did not judge others, then there would not be stereotypes. “Stereotypes are there to satisfy ignorance”- Dr. Yearwood.
