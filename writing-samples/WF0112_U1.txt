Comparison/Contrast Paragraph

Taking an English course both in high school and currently in college is completely different in a variety of ways. For instance, ENGL 101 class at my university meets for fewer days per week, may or may not cover the same or more material in less than half the time being for one semester and or require a significant amount of time outside of the class to completely master in the course. However, English class in high school usually meets every day for a yearlong course. Nonetheless, ENGL 101 students are expected to know how to word process, use technology when submitting or composing assignments, and knowing how to access available materials through online programs like Blackboard. Instead, high school English assignments were really handed in class or students only used a limited amount of technology. In high school English class, the teachers sometimes provided materials and questions to guide the student, conversely in ENGL 101 professors provides the material but key critical thinking skills are highlighted. Some examples may include making inferences, interpreting, analyzing, supporting arguments with evidence, and sharing ideas in open discussions or in your writings.
