IS FAITH AN ABSENCE OF THOUGHT?



As a Puritan, I believe faith is not necessarily an absence of thought but an aspect to trust over thought. Faith happens without any thought process at all, without any human control. Puritans merely follow the Bible word for word and believe that we do not control our own destiny but faith in God however, does. With Puritanism, it is more about having faith in God and Jesus Christ to lead you where you need to be in life, the things that happen to us are what God intends to happen to us and we have no control over it whatsoever. As a Puritan, if I follow all that is “pure” and take God’s word literally than he will guide my life in the right direction. Everything that happens, happens because God meant for it to and not because of consequences from our own thinking. 



As someone from the Enlightened era, our ability to think is more important and will lead us further in life than having faith in God. As an Enlightened thinker, I would say that for Puritans, faith is indeed an absence of thought. Puritans are not able to think for themselves and believe that a higher power decides every action of their lives. We are capable of coming up with rational solutions and conclusions for our problems instead of relying on God to fix our problems for us and guide us where we need to go. As an Enlightened thinker, I control my own destiny and my own life decisions and consequences and believe that religious superstition should not have bias on the decision making process.
