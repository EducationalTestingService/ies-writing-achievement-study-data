A Mule and 40 Acres Gone Wrong

Introduction: Hap is very much a tenant farmer because he didn’t rely on Henry for food and housing, had his own seeds and he had his own mule.

Sharecropping and tenant farming rose to prominence in the South since slavery was the main agricultural enterprise for decades. 

Hap tells Henry McAllan he will only work as a tenant farmer because of what he owned.

Paragraph 1	

The Jacksons owned their own crops which allowed them to keep some money even after they paid Henry.

 

This is a common difference between tenant farmers and sharecroppers.

Paragraph 2	

One of the main reasons the white sharecroppers were so poor was because they didn’t have a constant supply of seeds to grow crops. 

Hap Jackson, on the other hand, has his own seeds which means he owns the crops he grows.	

Paragraph 3

The huge factor that allows Hap to be a tenant farmer is that he owns a mule. 

This is something sharecroppers have to pay the landowner for along with seeds, rent and farming tools. 

Even though Hap still owns his own seed and home, the renting of the mule merged the dichotomy of sharecropping and tenant farming.	

Conclusion

Mudbound illustrated the agricultural progression in the South after slavery and how the differences affected the farmers. 

But with the fact that he owned his owned most of his property, it kept him and his family under the moniker of tenant farmer.
