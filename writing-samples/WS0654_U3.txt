	In the play Trifles written by Susan Glaspell, the women’s role in the scenes are perceived little to none importance compared to the men. The women are teased about focusing on thing that the men deem to be “trifles” such as the quilt the women have found. The men in the play immediately accuse Mrs. Wright being at fault because of the state of her kitchen. The women also have no first names as the men do. They automatically take the husband’s name as their own. Although the women are the main protagonists of the play they are treated as lesser. However, Mrs. Wright’s name was fully introduced as Minnie Foster, which was her name before she was married. It is implied that Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters can only help if they are cooperating with their husbands. The women also show inferiority through their movements. At one point they stand closer together. They seem to move together as if they were bonded throughout the play as well. The women also show sympathy to the broken preservatives and the dead bird. The men, however do not feel any sympathy to the broken items and dismiss them. The men think that their way of solving the crimes is the only way to go instead of looking at the smaller details, such as the dead bird, to put the missing pieces together.
