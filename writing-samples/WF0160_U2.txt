Although difficult to understand, one can be fairly certain that the narrator is giving a rather satirical description of a priest in lines 212-283 of The Canterbury Tales, "General Prologue". With descriptions such as, "Ful wel biloved and familiar was he" (248) and "He was an esy man to yive penaunce" (248), it is plain to see that the narrator is calling the priest out as a flirt. This is seen mainly in the very beginning of his portrait, and though the narrator describes the priest as a pleasant man, he also makes it clear to the audience that this priest maintains a rather pious attitude. This can be seen well in lines such as "For unto a poore ordre for to yive is signe that a man is wel yshrive" (249), showing that, though this priest could be seen as a "ladies-man" and definitely value money, he makes sure that his soul is "wel yshrive"(249), or well absolved, and without fault.
