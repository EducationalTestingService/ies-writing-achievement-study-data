Research Proposal

Flag Football vs. Contact Football

	The problem I wish to answer is “Is flag football a better alternative to contact football?” I believe through research we will find that flag football is both safer and a better option for time management and academics. I also think that kids and adults would much rather play and watch contact football even with these benefits.
	This is important because we could be saving time and money on academics for athletes in this sport, and also keep them from unnecessary injury. This is because studies have shown repeat trauma to the head can cause permanent effects, and these injuries all over the body can cause on going stress on the body over time.
	 I will interview my team of 8 other flag football players who have all played both flag football and contact football to get some statistics and opinions on the matter in that small group. This research will be finished at the end of this week to begin writing on the assignment.
