	In my opinion, On Being Brought from Africa to America has a very calm and meditative tone despite the backstory that accompanies the poem. After being taken from her home in Africa, she found a whole new life in her conversion to Christianity.  Upon hearing her story, you would think her poem would be filled with hate and pain because of what she has been through. But in this poem, she explains how she came to believe that there is a God and savior. Along with showing that black and white can both be Christians. In the poem, Wheatley uses Christianity to shed light on racial inequality that she experiences firsthand, aiming to break down notions about race. While Wheatley doesn't come out and mention race at the beginning of the poem, she does refer to Africa as "Pagan." That's probably because she didn't convert to Christianity until she moved to America. But a tension is set up here between Africa and America. It's almost as if Africa is bad, Pagan, and black, while America is good, Christian, and white. Wheatley argues that people of her race can be Christians as well as whites when she herself converted from mercy. Some could even compare the people to a coin. Different sides but part of the same coin correct? She also argues that blacks and whites are made from the same spiritual cloth and that both can “be refin’d, and join th’ angelic train” of salvation. Despite being positive about the fact that she is a slave she also reminds the readers the fact that Africans are not born to be enslaved; they possess equal rights as any other human being.
