	In my opinion Phillis Wheatley’s poem “On Being Brought from Africa to America” which talks about religion and racism is not sad or mournful. Wheatley obviously suffered through things and experienced horribleness that I just simply can not begin to describe or relate to. Yet, even though she experienced and suffered through so much this poem still has a sense of hopefulness and wonder to it. 

I believe that even though Wheatley know the horror and tragedy that her life will contain she is still hopefully and takes hope in her savior. Wheatley obviously appears to be a religious woman and this poem is just oozing with biblical references and allusions to that of God, Christ, etc. She speaks about how “Once I redemption neither sought, nor knew” which I interpret as that she knows and had come to terms with the fact that she would never see her freedom or the freedom of her people, there is another freedom that she can and has pursued. 

Perhaps the most moving part of the poem is that of its end when Wheatley states “Remember Christians, Negros, black as Cain, may be refin’d and join th’angelic train”. She says that even thought they are not equal on this earth and are viewed as evil (complete with allusions to Cain who is a biblical figure known for sin and murder), they can still be equal in death. That even though their bodies may not be viewed as equals, there souls will be equal in eternity in heaven.
