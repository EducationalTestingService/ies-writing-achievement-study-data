Efficacy of Polygraphs for Law Enforcement and Psychopathy

Abstract
This paper reviews existing literature on psychopathy, polygraphs, and the relationship between the two in a law enforcement setting. Psychopathy is a personality disorder mostly characterized by lack of empathy, egocentricism, manipulation, and antisocial behaviors (Zimak, Suhr, & Bolinger, 2014). Polygraphs, sometimes known as “lie-detectors”, are examinations meant to detect deception by measuring changes in involuntary physiological responses (Lewis & Cuppari, 2009). Use of polygraph examinations in recruitment of law enforcement is inconsistent across the United States. Polygraphs may be an important measure in the hiring process, in order to disallow psychopaths to gain positions of power within law enforcement. 

Efficacy of Polygraphs for Law Enforcement and Psychopathy
	 Law enforcement officers are trusted with the major responsibility of serving and protecting the general public. Because of this responsibility, it should be expected that recruitment and training processes for law enforcement officials are intensive and consistent. Recruitment and screening methods vary by department and location, but typically contain several universal components. These components may include background checks, character evaluations, physical agility tests, and others. According to Peak (2015), twenty six percent of police agencies in the United States implement a polygraph examination into their screening process. Polygraph examinations are used to determine truthfulness or detect deception in those undergoing examination (Lewis & Cuppari, 2009).
	Psychopaths are people that have a diagnosis of psychopathy, a personality disorder mostly characterized by antisocial behavior (Zimak et al., 2014). Psychopaths are known for their lack of empathy and remorse, thus allowing them to be potentially dangerous individuals (Zimak et al., 2014). Lacking empathy can often enable these individuals to use deception in order to satisfy their own wants or needs due to their self-centered nature (Zimak et al., 2014). By reviewing existing literature, the ability of polygraph examinations to detect deception in psychopathic individuals will be discussed. 
Literature Review
Law Enforcement Screening Process
	Qualified law enforcement officials should have specific characteristics and skills. Consistent recruitment and training processes can ensure that only men and women of good character and ability become police officers. According to Stone (1933), recruitment should include screening processes such as intelligence and aptitude tests, physical examinations, character investigations, and personal interviews. Some departments choose to implement a polygraph examination into this screening process.
How Polygraphs Work
	Polygraphs do not actually detect when a person is lying, but rather measure involuntary physiological responses that can be analyzed to detect possible deception (Lewis & Cuppari, 2009). Typically, when a person is being deceptive, there are physiological changes that occur, such as an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, perspiration, and respiration (Lewis & Cuppari, 2009). However, similar physiological changes can be observed from other states, not only from deception (Lewis & Cuppari, 2009).
There are multiple techniques available in conducting polygraph examinations. The first is the control question test, which consists of polygraph examiners asking a series of two types of questions: control questions and relevant questions. These two types of questions serve different purposes; control questions act as a baseline for comparison (Lewis & Cuppari, 2009). The responses to these two types of questions are compared for any discrepancies. Guilty persons are expected to react more strongly to relevant questions in comparison to the control questions (Verscheure, Crombez, De Clerq, & Koster, 2005).
A second method is known as the concealed information test (Verscheure et al., 2005). This testing method acts more as a multiple-choice examination, allowing the person being examined to reveal information that only someone guilty of committing a crime would know (Verscheure et al., 2005). However, this method is more useful when examining suspects rather than potential employees for law enforcement. 
Psychopathy
Characteristics. There is a widely accepted two-factor model for psychopathy, encompassing both interpersonal traits and antisocial behaviors (Zimak et al., 2014). The interpersonal traits characteristic of psychopathy include selfishness, manipulation, and superficial charm (Zimak et al., 2014). This two-factor model was first developed within a psychopathy checklist (PCL) in 1991, which has since been revised (PCL-R) (Skeem, Mulvey, & Grisso, 2003). People with psychopathy also have difficulty processing emotional stimuli, which contributes to the inability to feel empathy and remorse (Vitacco, Neumann, & Jackson, 2005). 
Psychopaths as law enforcement officials. Given their inability to properly process emotional stimuli, psychopaths cannot be empathetic and understanding; these are two traits that police officers should ideally have. Law enforcement officials are hired to serve the public, whereas psychopaths are committed to serving themselves only. For these reasons, it is necessary for law enforcement screening processes to filter out these individuals, disallowing them to become police officers. 
Detecting Deception in Psychopaths
	Potential issues. People with psychopathy often have manipulative tendencies as well as an inability to feel anxiety, allowing them to potentially be convincing liars (Patrick & Iacono, 1989). Psychopaths are generally unreactive and therefore may be thought to produce less of a response to relevant questions on a polygraph exam (Patrick & Iacono, 1989). Psychopathy is also characteristic of decreased activity in the limbic system, resulting in an altered electrodermic response without sufficient motivation (Mayoral et al., 2014).
	Deception easily detected. Raskin and Hare (1978) found that psychopaths were not able to evade detection of deception with the controlled question polygraph examination. Psychopaths were found to be no less reactive than nonpsychopaths; psychopaths even showed higher responses in some measures, such as skin conductance (Raskin & Hare, 1978). Skin conductance served as a better measure compared to respiration and heart rate for differentiating between truthful and deceptive subjects (Raskin & Hare, 1978). These findings have been replicated, showing that no significant differences exist between psychopaths and nonpsychopaths, even when comparing the extremes from these groups (Patrick & Iacono, 1989). 
Patrick & Iacono suggest that polygraph examinations are too structured for psychopaths to have a true advantage, contrary to other situations in which they may be able to be deceptive with less of a response (1989). However, it is suggested that review of the PCL-R prior to conducting a polygraph can be helpful, being that psychopaths may not react in the same way as neurologically healthy individuals unless properly motivated; therefore, there is an emphasis on the necessary skill of the polygraph examiner (Mayoral et al., 2014). Sufficiently motivated psychopaths do not display this same altered electrodermic hyporesponsiveness (Raskin & Hare, 1978). Two important factors in the detection of deception are the effectiveness of the control question and avoiding the assumption that lack of difference in responses to the two types of questions means the subject is responding truthfully (Raskin & Hare, 1978).
 	Countermeasures. Previous literature acknowledges the fact that physical or mental countermeasures could potentially allow subjects to avoid detection (Patrick & Iacono, 1989; Mayoral et al., 2014). Criminal training in these countermeasures may increase chances of successful deception, even for nonpsychopathic subjects (Mayoral et al., 2014). Subjects have been reported to avoid detection by employing countermeasures while going unnoticed by the examiners (Patrick & Iacono, 1989).
Discussion
Inconsistent Policies Nationwide
Efforts to implement polygraph testing into the hiring process for law enforcement officials have been inconsistent across the United States. Some departments have increased these efforts in recent years, whereas others have loosened their hiring requirements in an attempt to compensate for understaffed departments. For example, Ohio’s Attorney General was seeking to increase standards for police recruitment in 2015 by adding a polygraph examination (Bischoff, 2015). In January of this year, all law enforcement agencies in Athens, Ohio added polygraph testing into their hiring process (Gallion, 2017). 
On the contrary, in an effort to fill positions, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) received approval earlier this year to allow some candidates to skip the polygraph examination (Sacchetti, 2017). This allows current law enforcement officers at the state or local level who have previously passed a polygraph examination within the past ten years, as well as federal law enforcement officials and military members or veterans to skip the polygraph for the CBP (Sacchetti, 2017). The Pennsylvania State Police is another department that has discontinued use of the polygraph for recruits (Couloumbis, 2017). Unlike the CBP, the Pennsylvania State Police’s decision is indefinite rather than temporary.
Importance of Polygraph Implementation
Given the consistent ability to detect deception in psychopathic and nonpsychopathic individuals, polygraphs should be implemented in more departments rather than be removed from law enforcement hiring processes, especially in state and federal departments with budgets allowing this necessary screening procedure. Psychopaths are not individuals of high moral character, and should therefore not be hired into law enforcement positions. Police officers should not be highly manipulative, self-centered, and unable to feel empathy. Therefore, it is necessary for individuals with psychopathic characteristics to be screened out in the hiring process for law enforcement, which is partially made possible with the use of polygraph examinations.  
Conclusion
	Implementing polygraph testing into the recruitment process for law enforcement positions is a preventative measure that should be taken to ensure that law enforcement officials are men and women of certain character and ability. The legitimacy of each individual department is dependent on the character and actions of their employees. Ultimately, police legitimacy is important for ensuring voluntary public cooperation with the police (Tyler, 2004). Not only is legitimacy at stake, but also the risk faced if psychopathic individuals, whom are lacking moral character, are hired into positions that have the potential for abuse of power.
