Writing Assignment 2
Effects of classroom cell phone use on expected and actual learning
In study 2 a study was conducted Froese, Carpenter, Iman, Schooley, Barnes, Brecht, and Chacon (2012) where student texting was manipulated in a classroom setting. The main purpose of this study was to compare the effects of texting on quiz performance's, then compare it to the results found in study 1. It was hypothesized that the more texting and cell phone usage in class the lower the quiz scores get.

The researchers Froese, Carpenter, Iman, Schooley, Barnes, Brecht, and Chacon (2012) randomly selected 82 names from a list and 21 men and 19 women agreed to participate. They were asked to view a presentation twice in a classroom one while texting and the other not being engaged in their phones at all. Students were told they would be given a simple multiple-choice quiz at the end of the presentation. Students that were allowed to use their phone during the PowerPoints were also able to text and engage on their phones freely while the other participants couldnâ€™t.

The hypothesis was supported Froese, Carpenter, Iman, Schooley, Barnes, Brecht, and Chacon (2012) due to the fact that quiz scores were significantly lower when students texted during presentations. The difference of scores represented a 27% during hone usage/texting than non-texting.
