Stereotype Threat and Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
Stereotype Threat: The effect of a negative stereotype about one’s self upon one’s own test performance. (Anderson, Taylor, and Logio 2017: 424)
Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: The process by which merely applying a label changes the behavior and thus tends to justify the label. (Anderson, Taylor, and Logio 2017: 423)

A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy is a positive or negative stereotype that can affect the behavior of the individual being stereotyped, causing the stereotype to seem to come true. A Stereotype Threat is a negative stereotype that negatively affect the behavior of the individual being stereotyped, causing the stereotype to seem to come true.

This pair is similar in that they are both stereotypes that affect the behavior of the individual being stereotyped.

This pair is different in that a Self-Fullfilling Prophecy can result from either a positive or negative stereotype, but a Stereotype Threat only results from a negative stereotype.


An example of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy would be if a teacher assumed a student from an upper class background was able to perform well academically over a student from a lower class background and then treated them differently based on this assumption, causing the prejudiced assumption to come true.
