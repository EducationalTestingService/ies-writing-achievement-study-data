	When I was growing up curfew was something my mom made me have at a young age. She wanted me in by the time the street lights came on so I could stay out of danger and trouble. I know a lot of people who had the “street light” curfew and most of them were my friends. I believe that curves do keep teens out of trouble because they keep teens off the street, they are in the safety of their own home, and teen wouldn’t have much to do after a certain time anyways.

	For teens having a curfew is beneficial. Having a curfew would help teens because it keeps them off of the streets. This is good for the parent because their would be no worries of what their teen is getting into or doing however late it is. This also is good for the teen because it would give them a sense of respect or just to build more respect for their parent. Teens having a curfew will get them to be more responsible for themselves.

	Another good reason for teens to have a curfew is for the teens because nothing is better than being in your own home. If the teens parents had them on a curfew where the teen had to be home it would be great for the teen and the parent as well. The parent would be happy because their teen is in the safety of their of own home. The teen would be happy because they would not have to worry about getting into trouble with their parents. It would also help the teen because most have games they can play at home.

	Having a curfew can help both teen and the parent because their would not be much for the teen to do after a certain time anyways. After a certain time most things that happen at night are not for teens. Teens being out at night could lead to bad things and the curfew could stop all of those things. The parent would know that their child is not out at night doing things they wouldn’t want them to do.
