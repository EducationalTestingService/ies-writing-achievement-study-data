 

Is faith an absence of thought? 

	Is faith an absence of thought? The answer to this question depends on the individual. Some believe in religious principles while others believe in rationality and being in control. Faith being an absence of thought is not a question with one solid answer. 

	As a Puritan, oneâ€™s faith is not questioned. Our religious principles guide our thinking. With this being said, yes, faith is an absence of thought. We believe blindly in our faith and in God as our deity. We also believe that everything is predestined and ordained by God. We believe that things would not happen if God did not want them to be. God controls our life and our way of thinking. 

	In the Enlightened era, we base decisions on rationality. Much of our time is spent questioning and listening to reason. We do not believe that faith is an absence of thought. We do not believe much in religion because it is not something that is rational. Many of us do have morals, but do not believe in following religious principles alone. We do not believe that a higher power controls our destiny; we make our own paths in life. 

	In conclusion the individual is who decides if faith is an absence of thought or not. From the perspective of the Puritan faith is an absence of thought and they believe in God blindly. On the other hand the Enlightened individual does not believe that faith is an absence of thought because it is not rational. Rational or not each individual has their own thoughts on faith.
