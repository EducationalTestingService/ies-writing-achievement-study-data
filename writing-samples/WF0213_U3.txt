	Kambili Achike lives with her parents (Mama &Papa) and her older brother Jaja. Tension had grown between Jaja and Papa after he refuses to participate in communion one day at church. Papa is a very dedicated man to his religion. Everyone thinks highly of him even the pastor of the church. He is also a self-employed business owner, selling cashew Juice and is the publisher for a newspaper. Mama has had quite a few miscarriages, and she is certain that this time they baby will be delivered. Papa finds out she is pregnant and beats her again until she has a miscarriage. He sends her away and the next day she claims there has been an accident and that the baby is gone. Kambili is forced to live in the shadow of her father success. When she came second in class he lectured her about how he attained his success with a godless father and that she has one so she should always be first in her class. Aunty Ifeoma comes over the next day to see her family. The children are very different from one another in the lives they live. They all go to a festival and on the way they pick up Papa-Nnukwu who claims that the military has deceived his son into thinking he was a bad and godless person.
