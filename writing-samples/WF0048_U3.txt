These days one must be cautious of the actions they make on the internet.  A person’s online self is reflected in the things they search for, the transactions they make, and the things that are posted about them.  My online self would seem uninformed or unobservant because of all the “how to” videos I search for.  Also, when I’m struggling with a problem from a homework assignment, I might turn to the internet for help.  My online self would also appear to be a shopaholic.  At least once a week I find myself clicking on the “buy now with one click” button on Amazon.com.  Based on what others post about me, my online self is respectable, loving and intelligent.  These are just a few of the kind words that my mother and grandmother would use on a post about me to their Facebook friends.
