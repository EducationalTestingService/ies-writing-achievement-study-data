Trifles Short Story 


 

 Glaspell’s play Trifles relates to the real world in a huge way, it reflects the viewpoints of gender and sex roles.  Often times you hear about issues with women in the world around us. I know a long time ago the issue was much larger and a much bigger deal. But, even still to this day there is still problems with gender and sex roles. We live in a world that is constantly filled with drama and violence. I feel that this play is very much so relatable and is an enjoyable read for many in the world around us. This play also shows that women and men have different mind sets. Women and Men both view things in a different manner. In the play, there is one scene that sticks out to me on a level that paints a picture in my mind. At one point in the play the men cause a scene because they begin to feel that women don’t have the power/ ability to make a contribution to the investigation, to try and solve the murder case. Men feel that they can do it without the help of women. That’s basically how the title “Trifles” got its name because how men feel towards women. They begin to categorize and judge women and that causes the questioning of gender roles. This also describes the differences that are faced between men and women’s behaviors. In this play many situations arose that caused friction between men and women. I like how in this play they took the roles of one male and one female to seek out the adversity of the battles of the genders. The last point that this play covers is the idea that women were stuck at home and all their chores and daily abouts went unnoticed. This can go back as far as to when back in the old days women didn’t work only the men did. This poem speaks such high volumes and gets the point across about gender and sex roles.
