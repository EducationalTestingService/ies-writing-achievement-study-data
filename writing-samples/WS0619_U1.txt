If someone asked the ideal Puritan during this time period if they believed faith is an absence of thought, they would say no for obvious reasons. The Puritan ideology says they have faith in something that the “thinker” cannot see with the physical eye. This belief is something one can only sense. For example, the wind, you cannot see the wind but you can see the effects it has on the environment. They have a deep relationship with God and if one does not obey God, then they are doomed in Hell. They also believed they were put on the Earth for one purpose only: to glorify their God. The Puritans raise their children to obey God’s commands or suffer the consequences. There is really not thought process that is occurring as the child grows in age. Once the child has reached adulthood, their spiritual life has matured but very little change has occurred in their thinking. Therefore, they would argue that their faith is not an absence of thought, but a way of life. 

If someone asked the ideal Enlightened person during this time period if they believed faith is an absence of thought, they would say most definitely. This group of people began thinking instead of feeling. They began thinking realistically, questioning everyday problems that were usually looked over because it was “God’s plan.” The publishing of books aided in the spread of information. Along with these new thought patterns was disease and famine. The Enlightened people would say that faith is an absence of thought since they are constantly thinking.
