The Big Transition
    Moving from highschool to college is a very coming of age, life changing transition.
Just like every other change in life it is going to be new; even when you make plans you will never really be ready, just like any other growth in life. For example, Some people simply are not ready for that much freedom or not prepare for the work load. In high school the teachers and parents remind students constantly to do their homework, study for upcoming test and quizzes. In college student are now scholars and they do not realize the in the beginning. Sometimes in college scholars need in “eye opener” to understand exactly why they entered the college life and what is that they need to do to be successful. High school and college similarities and differences also depend on how for away from home student decide to further their education. Students will never truly understand until they go to college themselves.
