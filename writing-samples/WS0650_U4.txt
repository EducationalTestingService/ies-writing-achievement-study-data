The Author I Liked the Most and Why



I think my favorite author was the first one I learned about concerning this courseâ€”John Smith. I have always been a fan of spectical, and anything that I can paint a picture in my mind with. All the quizzes I took regarding his account of Virginia I aced, and it was because I didn't think his writing was hard to break down and understand. His account of Pocahontas and her rescuing him from her father was very dramatic and though I know some of it may have been hyperbolized, I still loved reading about it. Hearing a first hand account like his (though not all of it is trustworthy) really got me into the history of Jamestown and the people that were a part of the colony.
