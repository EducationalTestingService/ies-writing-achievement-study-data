In my opinion, Beowulf was a hero from the beginning of the poem to the very end. The poet writes, "There was no one else like him alive. In his day, he was the mightiest man on earth" (lines 196-197). Immediately, readers can sense that Beowulf is a powerful man who is a force to be reckoned with. So when Beowulf hears of how Heorot is being attacked by this monster, he orders a boat so that he may help Hrothgar and his people. When the boat hits the shore, readers are again given a statement about how wonderful and amazing Beowulf is when the watchman comments on him by saying, "Nor have I seen a mightier man-at-arms on this earth than the one standing here: unless I am mistaken, he is truly noble" (lines 247-250). It is easy to infer that Beowulf's fame is known both far and wide. I bring all this to your attention because it seems senseless that Beowulf would go and fight this dragon by his lonesome, because it indeed is, but in a sense it was the right thing to do. Beowulf could take men along with him to fight this dragon, but maybe he knew that this would be his last fight. Having this thought in mind, I think Beowulf takes pride in being the hero that he is known to be. Logically, I sense that he would want to die valiantly, ergo fighting this dragon alone. In the end, my personal belief is that he altogether does live up to his hero status.
