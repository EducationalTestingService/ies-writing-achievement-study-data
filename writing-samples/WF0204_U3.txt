Subject: CareerLeader and StrengthsFinder Analysis

Purpose:
The process of reviewing both my CareerLeader and StrengthsFinder reports has yielded invaluable insight as to my direction for the future. In this memo, I will describe my top five StrengthFinder traits, the content of my CareerLeader report, and the ways in which they are related with the intent of demonstrating how they’ll influence my future decision making.

StrengthFinder Results: 
The following contains a compilation of my five StrengthFinder traits, accompanied by a brief description of how they apply to my personality. A theme of strategic and relentless thinking will become evident. 

1)	My top trait is context. Being highly efficient, I like to build on proven methods of the past to arrive at optimal results for the future.

2)	Next comes competition. I am motivated by evaluating my own achievements in the context of others’ results. 

3)	At position three is analytical. Determining cause-and-effect relationships is not only a characteristic of mine, but also a passion. 

4)	Fourth is Ideation. Using critical thinking skills to create out-of-the-box solutions to complex problems is a unique strength of mine.

5)	Achievement rounds out my list. I am a merit-based, results-oriented individual, determined to succeed. 




CareerFinder Contents:
In almost perfection synchronization with my StrengthFinder traits, my CareerFinder results reiterate a theme of inclination for intense, analytical problem solving. This synchronization can be identified in all three sections of the report as follows:

1)	My interests – which indicate theory development and quantitative analysis as top scorers.

2)	My motivators – which present intellectual challenge as a primary success driver.

3)	My skills – which demonstrate evidence of proficiency in critical thinking and a merit-based personality orientation.  

Correlation of the Tests:
The shocking similarity between my StrengthFinder traits and CareerFinder analysis is obvious. My interests of theory development and quantitative analysis describe me as a creative, but logic-based personality that utilizes strategy in solving problems. When referenced to my top five traits, the intersection of these interests with context, analytical thinking, and ideation is made self-evident. 

The inter-connectivity goes deeper when examining my CareerLeader motivators. Remaining consistent with my thought-processing traits, intellectual challenge also integrates my competitive and achievement-based nature. I derive a lot of personal fulfillment from overcoming academic obstacles, so the synergy of this motivator with these traits is undoubtedly legitimate.  
	
To tie it all together, my reported skills of critical thinking and merit-orientation combine virtually all of the features of my top five traits into two succinct synopses. Context, analytics, and ideation all require a foundation of critical thinking, while merit-orientation describes the competitive and achievement traits’ unbiased use of metrics to determine success. 







Summary:
Overall, I am impressed with these assessments. The similarities between StrengthFinder and CareerLeader make obvious the talents I need to utilize to pursue a fulfilling career. From a decision-making standpoint, they’re mostly helpful in an affirmative sense.

My CareerLeader report indicated supply chain management and operations management as job positions geared to my personality and skill set. Picking a major has been an uncertain process for me, but as it stands, I am pursuing a supply chain management concentration and a mathematics minor. 

After reviewing both assessments, the doubts have been cleared over my course of study. It is undeniable that these subjects elicit the best use of my strengths. As a career option, I feel that supply chain management will be a perfect fit for my character type. These results won’t necessarily change my decision process, but will allow me to walk confidently down the path I have already chosen.
