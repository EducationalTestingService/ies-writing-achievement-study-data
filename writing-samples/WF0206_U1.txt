 Struggle with Society
In the essay “Letter to My Daughter” the author Maya Angelou uses pathos as a rhetorical device to persuade her audience that girls do not have to follow society norms. Growing up in Stamps, Arkansas, she describes the feeling of segregation. From being born as a black in the South to living with her mother in California, she is familiar with racism. In her hometown, she knew that segregation gave the idea that blacks are inferior to white people, however, she denies feeling inferior. Another problem is her body, it is not curvy and feminine as her society would approve for her young age. Due to the pressure by society towards women, this article, identifies how society tries to shape girls' thoughts and bodies. As Angelou is in the midst of finding her perfect body, her solution leads her towards an unexpected pregnancy. Society during this time period had been experiencing war and the great depression. It is during this time that Maya Angelou's intended audience are girls and women. She uses pathos and logos to describe the depression she goes through internally with the absence of her mother in the early stages of her life and how society encourages her to follow the standards of beauty.
To address the serious tone Angelou wants for the article, she uses short sentences. The time period had much to do with Angelou's way of expression, which is very solemn. Her way of expression persuades us to think about her emotional feelings, in particular her feelings towards family. During this time, the country was suffering the Great Depression. An article titled, "Exposure to rising inequality shapes Americans' opportunity beliefs and policy support", researched how the Great Depression affected the mentality of the American people. People were in a serious and worried state about their country because of the lack of jobs for family's and containing socialism. Her time period was difficult and to portray this she uses short sentences, paragraphs with one or three sentences and recurring commas to make pauses. Angelou's way of proving her readers her story, is in this similar mood of despondency. It was interesting to see that her paragraphs describing her home, philanthropy and giving birth were longer than the one sentence paragraphs describing her intimacy with a boy and her resulting pregnancy. Her short sentences, though they seem to convey little emotion, actually contain all of it. The level at which she talks more about is the degree of importance she gives her subject. Angelou persuades the audience to focus on her writing structure because in it you find her feelings and emotions.
The tone she uses to explain her relationship with her mom and how she became pregnant were both defensive. Before the conclusion of war, the country was tense. These times influenced her to act hostile towards her mother when she moved at age thirteen to live with her in California. In fact, during her stay she accidentally smiled when her mom was trying to get her to laugh. This moment is used to persuade girls, her intended audience, that mothers will always love you even if you doubt it. She learns to be a giver of smiles through that experience, persuading the audience to think that giving yourself is much more valuable than giving materialistic things. Her other defensive tone was used when explaining to her mom her pregnancy. She defended herself saying, "No, he's the only person with whom I had sex and we were together only one time" (Angelou 5). She says this even though her mom never asked with how many other boys had been with. Yet, it is reasonable for her to defend herself knowing the social norms during this time. Society would disapprove teenage pregnancy and she would lose the morals earned in her faith through the help of her grandma, whom she admired greatly. Angelou's message is clear. She wants girls to understand that her action was wrong but persuades them to think that getting pregnant is not the worst thing that could happen. The serious tone towards the end becomes softer to suggest that family are those who care for one another in times of need. 
Winning and restoring the economy, on VJ day, after the war and the Great Depression made the country prideful. It was during this time that Angelou gave the news of her pregnancy to her parents. To her surprise, they felt a kind and loving acceptance of the grandchild. Angelou mentions the accepting moment of her family, but, tries to persuade the audience to dismiss why this happened. We can infer, using logos, that the availability of jobs and the market back on track, was the real reason why her parents accepted the news with happiness and support. Raising a child during a time prior to this would not have been accepted into a welcoming family, in a time such as the Great Depression. The author is trying to persuade its readers that teenage pregnancy will be accepted by loving parents, even though it may go against morals and beliefs, which were what she once protected. This contradicts Angelou at the beginning of this article when she mentions how she protected her learned values, imitating only her grandma with religious music, news and being quiet humming around only religious music. The author informs herself as not being too attached to her values taught by her grandma as she projected herself to be when she chose to have sex with a boy. Angelou uses pathos again to persuade us to believe that family should always be the comforting shoulder, especially parents like it was in her situation. She is informing her audience that pregnancy should not hold a girl to unhappiness or domestic chains and how other women should help each other emotionally when in times of struggle. She persuades the audience to think that girls do not need men in order to have a living or feel valued when her mother offers her all the help she may need. 
Most of the time, in today's world and in the past, if you weren't married this was seen as a terrible influence on society but what motivates her to be content with the child was that it had a loving grandmother who accepted it. The author uses logos to persuade the audience that there should not need to be approval, from anyone, to be happy when having a child. People were relatively new to bombardments to media but not new to social pressures. Listening to media was all one wanted to hear. With the new outcome of radios and television lives were going to change for good. This right here was the reason most likely why her parents felt almost proud of her daughter, the war was over and all new electronics were starting to revolutionize the world. Families would become the center focus, with females waiting for their husbands at home. The perfect homes were being made and it was no surprise that her life would be full of joy if the child was born during the age of prosperity in the country. 
In addition to providing pathos when talking about family communication, Angelou's lonely childhood persuades the audience into agreeing with her adolescent resentment towards her mother. Growing up in a religious yet dysfunctional household in the early years of her childhood life, impacts her way of thinking for the rest of her life. Usually the abandonment becomes a permanent feeling and resentment, towards a parent, in a child when they reach adolescence. Angelou grows up with grandma Annie Henderson whom she admired because of her patience, peace and humming of religious songs. Keeping Angelou safe and by her at all times, enjoying each other's company plays a beautiful part in her childhood. On the other hand, this is unfair to her developmental skills because she has had no social interactions, experiences, and outside media influences, in fact this is especially known as a risk factor for teenage pregnancy, according to a peer reviewed research article of the "Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry". There is no doubt that being with her grandmother helped her stay protected from the outside world. This world where she was scared away from white children because of her race and color. This pessimistic view of her life at an early age made her convinced of how, "...most people do not grow up" (Angelou 1). The sorrow and anger can be felt in her reading, with short sentences and no emotion. An article in named "The inventory of parent and peer attachment: Individual differences and their relationship to psychological well-being in adolescence" explains in their study using 13 to 20 year old's, Burke and Weir found that those adolescents expressing greater satisfaction with help received from peers, and particularly from parents, experienced greater psychological well-being (Volume 16;  Issue 5, pp 427–454). This anger, then, that Angelou feels towards her mother when she moves to California to live with her for the first time, should be seen as normal. 
The audience is persuaded to think she is tough and strong by her style of writing. The struggles, lonely feelings and anger are clear in her writing because of her sentence structures. They consist of short paragraphs and sentences, ending with periods. In this quick story of her life told, the only one thing that stands out is her child, whom she says changed her life for good. Society sees teenage pregnancy as something bad, yet, the act of sex as not. Angelou persuades her audience on this point by implying that a child does not always have to seem bad and as something tragic but instead of as an encouragement to move on, accepting the help offered. In a study about social pressures in an article titled "Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment", provides strong statistical evidence of social pressures proved in an experiment using voting, which turned out to be great. Now this was with adults, in a teenager this is far worse. Women should be proud of conceiving a child. Her exclamation and only paragraph with most sentences is when she speaks of her son. Angelou persuades her audience to also not believe in the right to abortion because of religious teachings. Taught to her in her childhood she relates to the audience who has possibly been given religious teachings as well. Angelou's personal story has no 
The audience to whom she speaks is to parents but mainly girls from a perspective of a loving mother. The use of pathos is used throughout this whole writing of her paper. She persuades her audience to think that home, parents and growing up are all sufferings in this world for a girl without her parents. Using pathos, she persuades her audience to feel that woman should have more love and sympathy for her life story but most especially for other women. In her writing she persuades her audience that forgiveness can create a greater bond than there existed between a parent and a son or daughter when there had been no reconciliation. 
Angelou ends her article with an emotional attachment. She persuades her audience into believing that happiness is found if you go against social norms and to learn to forgive. The time period of her pregnancy was during a great prosperity for the United States and she uses this, as well as the bad childhood period of the Great Depression to conclude that her intended audience will always see the good after something that is considered "bad" in society. Looking at the social, cultural and historical backgrounds during her stages in life, you can see the reasons why she lacked love towards her mother and herself. Angelou's message through the use of pathos, persuades the audience to think that social pressures into becoming the "woman" image manipulate girls and woman to uphold the standards of beauty and maternity above her wants and needs.
