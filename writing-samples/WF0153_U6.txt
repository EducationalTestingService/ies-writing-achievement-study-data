The Effect of Major Parameters and Vital Capacity in the Principles of Biology Students

Abstract

The relationship between vital capacity and the other parameters considered affecting their values such as height, chest circumference and resting pulse rate was investigated in the Principles of Biology students (n = 96), respectively. Three replicates of vital capacity were measured by each subject in the sitting and standing position as well as the other parameters: sex, age, smokers, and athletes. Correlation between vital capacity standing and these parameters were determined. Pearsonâ€™s Correlation coefficient analysis was used and there was a significant relationship between vital capacity standing and both height and chest circumference (p<0.05). However, significant relationship was not determined between vital capacity standing and heartbeats/min. As height and chest circumference increased, there was a corresponding significant increase in vital capacity standing, suggesting that lung volume was directly related to the height and chest circumference. In contrast, the pulse rate was not related to the vital capacity standing, suggesting that not enough data was collected to discuss its relationships and the other parameters such as sex, age, smokers, and athletes.
