The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks Summary





Published in February 2010 “The immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” by Rebecca Skloot pages 1-104 explains the troubles of Henrietta Lacks discovering a lump the size of a nickel in her cervix. When she went to the hospital the doctor stated “No note is made in the history at that time…”. 3 months later it became a tumor. When Henrietta’s mother died from the birth of her 10th child, Henrietta and her brothers and sisters were split up and sent to different relative houses. Henrietta stayed with her grandfather and Henrietta and her cousin took care of the animals on the farm and tended the tobacco field. Henrietta ended up having 5 children with her cousin (Day) soon later married at 20. Going to Hopkins hospital to get treated for cancer, the doctor took samples of Henrietta tumor and sent it to Gey’s lab for culturing. In Gey’s lab Henrietta’s cells started growing uncontrollably. 



Henrietta started to feel sick after the treatment. 11 years later Rebecca talks to Henrietta husband about writing a book about her cells. Researchers did experiments on Henrietta cells to see how it would react to certain treatments. When Henrietta went to the doctors, the doctor noted, “The patient states she feels fairly well”. Which was false. X-rays showed tumors spreading all over her body. Rebecca travels to Baltimore, gets lost then meet “mama sons”. 



Rebecca tries to find Henrietta Grave in Virginia to learn more about her. Rebecca runs into Henrietta first cousin Hector Henry who tells her more information about Henrietta. Henrietta Family and friends donated blood because she was running low. Henrietta soon later died on october 4, 1951. Gey wanted to do cell samples from her organs but Day refused permission for an autopsy. Her cells became famous and people wanted to learn more about where they came from.
