In the article "Facebook is Using You" by Lori Andrews, she describes how there any many advantages and disadvantages that are given by the Internet. Companies can gather data from searches made on the Internet and sources like social media without consent from the owner. The writer informs the reader of the threats directed to people who are using the Internet, whether it be a daily user or an intermittent user. While learning about the author, the reader can make the conclusion that this piece of work is probably meant to be informative. With her most recent book being about the “cultural and political consequences of online social networking,” this may lead one to believe that what they are about to read could be fairly similar to what she recently wrote.
Therefore, there are several writing methods that Andrews utilizes such as persuasiveness and description that helps get her purpose fed to the reader. In the text, the author uses persuasiveness by providing evidence that helps to back up her claim. In the essay, she states that when "an Atlanta man returned from his honeymoon he found that his credit limit had been lowered to $3,800 from $10,800." She appeals to the reader by using something that they can relate to, such as money, to aid them in acknowledging how serious the matter is. Also, Andrews demonstrates the use of description by stating examples. Since companies have the opportunity to lurk onto people's personal information, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services "have been known to scrutinize photos and posts to confirm family relationships or weed out sham marriages." The author appeals to the reader's sense by describing how things as personal as family photos can determine your future of how the government can view you. The fact of the matter is that the government has not established a law that does not allow companies to meddle in personal lives of citizens shows there may not be "liberty and justice for all" after all.
