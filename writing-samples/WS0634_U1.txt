Scenario 1: No, faith is not the absence of thought but more so present is the belief of what the Bible says. The Bible is interpreted by the Holy Spirit. In turn the Puritans believe what is told to them by the clergymen for they have the direct line to the Holy Spirit. The art and literature is all related to the teachings of the church. 



Scenario 2: Yes, faith is the absence of thought. Without this absence there would be no Enlightenment. As intellectuals we believe in free thought. Free thought gives us the advantage of doubt as well as being able to interpret the Bible and other things as we see fit. This allows for other people to see that everything is not related to thought as well as opens up new avenues for art and literature to be written.
