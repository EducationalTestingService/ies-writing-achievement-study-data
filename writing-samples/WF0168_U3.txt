In this comedic television show called “Black-ish”, Anthony Anderson plays a family loving dad who brings a holiday called Juneteenth to everyone’s attention. Andre Johnson (played by Anthony Anderson) tries to figure out ways to bring “Juneteenth to the publics’ attention because there’s a significance behind that day, it’s not a popular celebrated holiday and some people don’t feel the need to celebrate the holiday. Andre was first introduced to “Juneteenth” at his children’s third grade play which was highlighting Christopher Columbus. His father told him the name of the holiday but he took it upon himself to discover the actual meaning of it and how he was going to bring it to the attention of others. He started by trying to have Aloe Blacc write a song to end Columbus Day and advocate “Juneteenth”. His coworkers commented on the subject and not all were in agreeance to “Juneteenth”. Mr. Stevens, Connor Stevens, and Josh (played by Peter Mackenzie, Nelson Franklin, and Jeff Meacham) all disagreed to Andre advocating for “Juneteenth” to become a national holiday. They felt that Martin Luther King Day, or Black History Month was enough. Whereas Charlie Telphy, and Daphne Lido (played by Deon Cole, and Wanda Sykes) were more understanding of the significance and why people should celebrate the holiday. After talking with his coworkers, Andre realized that the song was a pointless idea. Him and his family came to the conclusion that the only way to start advocating the holiday was to start with their household. At the end of the episode, Andre didn’t get “Juneteenth” out there to the world, but he did make it present in his household.
