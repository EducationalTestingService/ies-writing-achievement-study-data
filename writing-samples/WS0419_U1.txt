Trump Affair
	In The Washington Post “I have to see you again..” , authors Frances Sellers, Emma Brown, and David Fahrenthold discusses the alleged affair that took place between the United States president, Donald Trump, and adult actress, Stephanie Clifford- also popularly known as Stormy Daniels. The affair took place in the summer of 2006, in the midst of a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe; “Trump was there for golf. Daniels was there for work.” In any case, Trump invited the 27 year old porn star to dinner in his hotel suite; however, when Daniel's arrived Trump was dressed in his pajama pants, signaling that something other than dinner would ensue that night. Daniels explains that her and Trump had sex, then discussed his promise of her appearing on his already then failed show “The Apprentice”. A keynote to this entire story is that Daniels states that “Trump didn’t say anything about keeping their encounter a secret.” - “He didn't seem worried about it.” On the contrary, Trump and his attorney - Michael Cohen- have firmly addressed all these allegation to be untrue, yet there have been several other women, such as Jessica Drake, who claim Trump had invited them up to his suite and made such advances on them as well. In all the speculation and allegations, one thing that rings fully true is that Cohen did indeed propose  $130,000 reward in exchange for Daniels silence due to the fact that  it was 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. In any news, Trump won, and attorney Cohen son after sought to pull the agreement between him and Daniels because “she had violated the 2016 agreement.” Many citizens may wonder, If this case is supposedly “alleged”, why are there circumstances involving the secrecy of it?
