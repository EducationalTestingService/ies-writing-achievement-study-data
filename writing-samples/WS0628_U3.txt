In my opinion, On Being Brought from Africa to America, is an excellent piece of poetry but it involves a deeper message. When I first read the poem, I was quite confused actually because I couldn’t understand why she was feeling so thankful. As a young female from Africa who had been kidnapped and taken for slavery, you wouldn’t think thankfulness is something she would feel or express in anyway. Even in the title, you immediately assume that it has something to do with slavery however she does not cast her attention on the fact that she is being enslaved but the fact that she has been shown the power of God and Christianity. As she says in her poem that being brought from her “Pagan land” taught her to understand that there is a savior too. Her whole life she was taught that being black was a bad thing, that she deserved what she was being put through but coming from Africa to America she came to the realization that there is a God that loves her even if she’s black. As the poem says, “Remember Christians, Negroes, black as Caine, May be refin’d and join th’ angelic train.” Meaning that she has no worries about her life anymore because she believes now that when she dies, God will indeed accept her even though she is black. This leading her to keep a positive outlook on life because she Is reminded though her life is not good now, she will one day be in Heaven with God due to her newly found Christian belief.
