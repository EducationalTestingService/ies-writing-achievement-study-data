	I think the main emotion I felt when reading parts of the Age of Reason was curiosity and fear. Curious to learn more about it and try to keep an open mind when reading. Growing up in north Georgia, in the bible belt, Christianity has been instilled or ingrained in me since I was a young child. This believe that there is a superior being and we are here to serve him, but Thomas Paine opens a lot of questions I’ve already had about the church. Like is the church just here for money and power? Do they try to grow their congregation for political purposes? It makes you think if everything you’ve studied about it could be a sham. I would like to think the church is almighty and only good people work there but history has shown us otherwise. I guess that is where faith comes in, you just must have faith that and believe in your religion. He makes a great point tying all religions together saying every religion has a certain book and a figurehead like the Jews with Moses, Christianity with Jesus, and the Turks with Mahomet. How do we know which religion is correct if they all have the supposed word of God but all disbelief each other? I think that is a question with an impossible answer. The next emotion that got brought up was fear. Fear that this almost sacrilegious. Fear that if there is God am I angering him by questioning the stories told in the bible? I imagine not a lot has changed over time since this came out, people from the early 1800’s to 2018 still feel the same emotion of curiosity and fear when they read Thomas Paine’s Age of Reason.
