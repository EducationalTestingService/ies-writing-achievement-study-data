Though Papa is just one person, Adichie depicts two sides of Papa. Papa has his public image and his private image. One aspect of Papa’s public image is that he is modest and kind. During a sermon, the priest describes to the congregation about how much Papa does for the church and his modesty. Papa’s private image on the other hand can be harsh. He slammed Jaja’s head for not participating in the communion. His public image is also depicted as being brave. One of the Papa’s editors was arrested for writing the truth and Papa was the one who did everything he could to free him. The editor showed his gratitude by writing about Papa’s bravery in freeing him. Papa’s private image can be a little weak and the opposite of being brave. Papa avoids the problems with his family and does not want to face the problems head on. The last aspect of Papa’s public image is he is accepting of what his family does. When in public, Papa does not show too much criticism. While his private image show that he expects alot from his children and his wife. Papa expects his children to be first of their class. He was not satisfied of his child being second and thinks she did not try as much as she could.
