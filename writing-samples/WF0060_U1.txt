Dear Casey Smith:
I am applying for the position of Administrative Associate, posting 56449. My administrative background includes Administrative Assistant, Front Desk Clerk, Data Input Specialist, Accounts Receivable, and other various duties. I have extensive experience in managing client relations and keeping accurate records. I love to interact with and help improve people’s day by getting them what they need with efficient and amazing service. I have worked successfully as both an individual and as a member of team. Microsoft programs, customer service, and office tasks are just part of how I fit so well with this position.
I have an AAS in Business Administration, which helped me develop skills in communication, critical thinking, and general business practices. I am currently attending college, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Development. It is my intention to gain employment while pursing my bachelor’s degree with a company that I can continue working hard for after graduation, and this administrative position with Beach Bagels absolutely fulfills that.
Besides my administrative background, I served for three years in the US Army as a helicopter technician. In the military, I interacted with people from all types of backgrounds and have maintained relationships with many of the people I served with. We had to work accurately, efficiently, and as a team in order to get jobs done. I learned how to take care of others and the importance of maintaining proper standards. I also had to maintain a Secret level of security clearance.
My resume is attached to the application, and you can contact me at (555) 555-5555 or via email at samdoe@uni.edu. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this position!
Sincerely,
Sam Doe
