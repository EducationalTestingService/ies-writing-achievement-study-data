Being a full-time college student comes with many obstacles that you are faced with daily. Money is one of the largest and most important factors a student needs to even begin taking classes. There are several fees included with being a full-time student such as room and board, books, meal plans, and every day expenses such as toiletries or transportation. As a young adult pursuing a higher education, I am expected to do many things on top of paying for institutional fees. Maintaining good grades and including extracurricular activities into your weekly schedule as well can be very stressful for anyone. 

Since I am depending on a single parent, I know that paying for college can be expensive and my mother has made a lot of sacrifices for me to attend the school of my choice. Being the oldest of my motherâ€™s children, there is a lot of pressure on me to do well in school and continue to grow into the woman that my mother worked so hard to raise. I believe that I deserve this scholarship because I know that I have pushed myself every single day to be a good student and kept good grades. Thus far, I have been able to keep a GPA of 3.0 since my first semester of college. Studying late at night, going to tutoring sessions, and meeting with my professors outside of classes has contributed to assisting me with maintaining my good grades. I plan to continue my strategy all throughout the rest of my college years to not only graduate within four years to get me closer to my dream career, but to make my family proud of the responsible young adult I have become.
