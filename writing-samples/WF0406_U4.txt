Spirometry data for female (n=71, ages 17 to 24) Principles of Biology students were variable (Table 1). Their average VC standing ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, with an overall average of 2.8 L, while their VC sitting ranged from 1.8 to 4.2 L, averaging 2.8 L (Table 1). Females ranged in height from 150 to 183 cm, averaging 164.9 cm, and their chest circumference (cm) ranged from a low 67 cm to a high of 127 cm, averaging 87.5 cm (Table 1). The females’ average heartbeats per minute (bpm) ranged from 50.4 bpm to 100 bpm, with an overall average of 76.5 bpm (Table 1). There were only 2 female smokers. Their average VC was 2.8 L while standing, and 2.8 L while sitting. For female nonsmokers (n=69), average VC (standing and sitting) ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, and from 1.8 to 4.2 L, respectively (Table 1). Their overall VC averages were 2.9 L (standing) and 2.7 L (sitting). For female athletes (n=24), average VC ranged from 2 to 3.9 L (standing), and 1.8 to 4.2 L (sitting), respectively. Overall the averages of the female athletes’ VCs were 2.7 L (standing) and 2.6 L (sitting) (Table 1). For female non-athletes (n=47), average VC ranged from 1.8 to 3.8 L (standing), and 1.8 to 3.8 (sitting), respectively. Their overall VC averages were 2.9 L (standing) and 2.9 L (siting) (Table 1).
