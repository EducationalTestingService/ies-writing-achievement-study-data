An Intellectual Response
	The article we focused on as a class assignment during our third week of instruction was, “Hidden Intellectualism,” By English professor Gerald Graff. His article hits key scenarios that view intellectualism in various manners; many in which are not as recognized as you would think such impacting intellectualism would be focused on more than it currently is today. 
	Taking a brief analyzation of the portion of Graff’s writing where he demonstrates the “hidden intellectualism his article revolves around; specifically when he introduces the sports scenario. Graff begins to dissect the factors that create football; he says, “sports occasionally forced one to confront real issues like racial injustice,as when Jackie Robinson broke through baseball’s color line in 1947...Furthermore, sports arguments, debates, and analyses made you part of a community, not just of your friends but of the national public culture…(Graff,27-28).”
These demonstrations of racial injustice, formal debates, and first hand experiences are the pillars that are filled with this, “hidden intellectualism,” Graff wants the reader to understand; to be able to understand what is happening and to react in a logical and formal sense is key. 
	Society overlooks the present evolutions that happen all around us. We focus on our personal values so much to the point where we do not get to explore the depth of certain aspects in life. Lengthy and critical analysing along with a mindset of reality based on culture are key when coming to conclusions. Basically, everyone needs to take time to analyse the who, what , when , and where extensively from a realistic view of positivity.
