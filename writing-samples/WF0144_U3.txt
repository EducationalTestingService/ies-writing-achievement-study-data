Comparison Paragraph
English 101 and General Psychology are comparable because both classes require a lot of reading, studying, and note-taking. For psychology, we must read seventeen long chapters and for English, we are required to read three long-drawn-out books. In Psychology, we are expected to complete the text, “What is Psychology?”, which contains seventeen chapters and over one hundred key terms. We go through a new chapter every week and the chapters are split into a total of five tests. Similarly, In English, we must read “Purple Hibiscus”, “The Bedford Reader”, and “The Little Seagull Handbook”. We are given many different assignments for each book including essays, tests, and diagnostics. Both classes require critical and extended reading.
