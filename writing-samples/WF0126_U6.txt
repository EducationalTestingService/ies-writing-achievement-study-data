Hi Everyone! My name is Sam and I am a junior. I am majoring in business administration with a concentration in operations management (or supply chain management) and I hope to work in the aviation or health care field. Ideally I would work in a combined field like organ donation coordination.

I think that having good business communication skills will benefit me in my field because it will allow me to relate to all other concentrations. All concentrations of business are intertwined, so if I cannot talk to someone in the accounting department, we cannot do our jobs effectively.  In my concentration of operations management, I might need to streamline a process and I need to be able to describe the plan I have. If I cannot describe that plan, it will not turn out the way I intended. If I were to work in a field such as organ donation coordination, I would need to communicate with a large variety of people to match organs and figure out logistically how we get the organ where it needs to be on time. Communication is crucial in business because it is how we network. Whether it is through email, memos, or in person, the better a communicator you are, the better success you will have with coworkers and other business professionals. I can improve my overall communication ability by getting out of my comfort zone as well as putting forth the effort needed to achieve my goals.

I am interested to see how this course plays out, but I think it is neat to combine a business skills class with an English class. It should be very helpful. My goals for this class are to improve on skills that will assist me as a business professional and to gain confidence in my writing. Now that my English classes can focus on writing I will use through my professional life, I feel as though I can identify with the assignments more and I believe that will help me in reaching my goals.
