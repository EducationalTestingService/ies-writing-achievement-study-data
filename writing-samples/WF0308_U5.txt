Abstract
The objective of this scientific study was to find correlations, if any, between VC in liters (L)and height (cm), chest circumference (cm), resting heart beats per minute, and other parameters. 96 Principles of Biology students at University, individually conducted three trials to find VC standing and sitting respectively. The students also collected their height (cm), chest circumference (cm), resting heart beats per minute, as well as, age genders, and whether or not they were smokers, and athletes, respectively. It was found that VC standing and height had a positive correlation (r = 0.715, n= 96, p= 0.05), VC standing and heart beats per minute has no correlation (r = -0.124, n = 96, p = 0.05)., and VC standing and chest circumference had a positive correlation (r = 0.449, n = 96, p = 0.05). In conclusion, while VC correlated with chest circumference and height, it did not with heartbeats per minute. 

























Introduction

Spirometry studies in the past have found how vital capacity (VC) may be impacted by stature, age, gender, health status and life status. VC is defined as the maximum amount of air that a person can exhale after a maximum inspiration (Seeley et al., 2008). An instrument called a spirometer was first invented by John Hutchinson in the 1800s (Petty, 2002), and was used to measure the capacity to live which is now known as VC. VC was found to increase/decrease based on someone’s sex, age, body size, and physical activity (Seeley et al., 2008). An example of this being that trained athletes sometimes have a VC 30%-40% above those that are not trained (Seeley et al., 2008). Other factors, like smoking, could lower VC, and more specifically than that stated above, height and chest circumference could raise VC if the individual was taller and had a larger chest. For example, men tend to be taller than women, and it was found in a past study that males tend to have a greater VC than females (Youssef et. al., 2015). Not only can VC be affected by these parameters, these parameters have also been used to predict VC (Parma et al., 1995). Knowing ones’ VC can help identify patients that are at risk of many different diseases. Some of these diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, heart attack, stroke, and all-cause mortality (Petty, 2002). 

The purpose of this study was to investigate if there was a relationship between VC and other parameters such as sex, smoker/non-smoker, age, athlete/non-athlete, height, chest circumference, and resting pulse rate. The overall objective of this study was to collect spirometry data from college students which would be analyzed for factors affecting VC. The hypothesis tested was that the VC correlated with the other parameters including stature, resting pulse rate, gender, age, and lifestyles. 
Materials and Methods
In a spirometry study, University’s Principles of Biology students, laboratory sections L54, L55, L56, and 03C, measured their vital capacity (VC) in liters (L). In all, 96 students participated, 25 being males and 71 being females, with ages ranging from 17 to 34 years old. Each student recorded his/her individual VC in triplicate while standing and sitting respectively. VC was measured using the Phipps and Bird 9-Liter Wet Spirometer. The average VCs were found for both positions by each student.
	
The student also collected three other measurements there being chest circumference (cm), height (cm), and resting radial pulse. Chest circumference was found using a tape measure and height was found using a meter stick. After resting for ten minutes, pulse rate of each student was found by the index and middle fingers of one hand on the radial artery of the other arm and counting the number of pulse in three fifteen-second intervals. A Mychron stopwatch was used to precisely time each of the fifteen-second interval. The average number of pulse for each student was then multiplied by four to find each student’s resting average heart beats per minute. Individuals also recorded their ages, genders, and whether or not they were smokers, and athletes, respectively. Correlation analysis was used to statistically analyze the data for any correlation between VC and the other parameters examined. 

Results
Spirometry data for female (n= 71, ages 17 to 24) Principles of Biology students were variable (Table 1). Their average VC (standing) ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, with an overall average of 2.8 L, while their VC (sitting) ranged from 1.8 to 4.2 L, averaging 2.8 L (Table 1). Females ranged in height from 150 to 183 cm, averaging 164.9 cm, and their chest circumference (cm) ranged from a low of 67 cm to a high of 127 cm, averaging 87.5 cm (Table 1). The females’ average heartbeats per minute (bpm) ranged from 50.4 to 100 bpm, with an overall average of 76.5
 bpm (Table 1). There were only 2 female smokers. For female non-smokers (n= 69), average VC (standing and sitting) ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, and from 1.8 to 4.2 L, respectively (Table 1). Their overall VC averages were 2.8 L (standing) and 2.8 L (sitting). For female athletes (n= 24), average VC ranged from 2 to 3.9 L (standing), and 1.8 to 4.2 L (sitting), respectively. Overall averages of the female athletes’ VCs were 2.7 L (standing) and 2.7 (sitting) (Table 1). For female non-athletes (n= 46), average VC ranged from 1.8 to 3.8 L (standing), and 1.8 to 3.8 L (sitting), respectively. Their overall VC averages were 2.7 L (standing) and 2.8 L (sitting) (Table 1).

In males, VC (standing) ranges from 2.7 to 5.4 L, with an overall average of 4.4 L, while their 
sitting VC ranged from 2.8 to 5.2 L, with an overall average of 4.5 L (Table 2). They varied in height from 168 to 188.4 cm, showing an average height of 178.2 cm. Chest circumference (cm) in males ranged from 83 cm to 112 cm, averaging 98.6 cm, while their average heartbeats per minute ranged from 56 to 93.3 bpm, showing an overall average of 73.5 bpm (Table 2). There were no male smokers. The non-smoking males (n= 25), had an average VC (standing) that ranged from 2.7 L to 5.4 L, and from 2.8 L to 5.3 L (VC, sitting) (Table 2). Their overall average VCs were 4.4 L (standing) and 4.5 L (sitting). In male athletes (n = 13), the average standing and sitting VCs ranged from 2.7 to 5.1 L, and 2.8 to 5.2 L, respectively (Table 2). The overall averages of VC for male non-athletes were 4.4 L, (standing) and 4.4 L (sitting). 

Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of height (cm) against VC standing (L) for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their heights from 150 to 188.4 cm. The scatter plot suggested a positive correlation, that is, as standing VC (L) increased, height (cm) also increased. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was a significant relationship between standing VC (L) and height (cm) because the calculated value (0.715) exceeded the tabulated value (0.201) at p = 0.05 (r = 0.715, n = 96, p = 0.05). The Null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between height and VC (standing), was therefore rejected.

Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of heart beats per minute against VC standing (L) for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their heart beats per minute from 50.4 to 100 bpm. The scatter plot suggested no correlation between the two. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was no significant relationship between standing VC (L) and height (cm) because the calculated value (-0.124) is less than the tabulated value (0.201) at p= 0.05 (r = -0.124, n = 96, p = 0.05). The Null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between heart beats per minute and VC (standing), can therefore not be rejected.

The scatter plot suggested a positive correlation, that is, as standing VC (L) increased, chest circumference (cm) also increased Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was a significant relationship between standing VC (L) and chest circumference (cm) because the calculated value (0.449) exceeded the tabulated value (0.201) at p = 0.05 (r = 0.449, n = 96, p = 0.05). The Null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between chest circumference and VC (standing), was therefore rejected.

Discussion
To begin, there was a significant positive correlation between height (cm) and VC standing (L), that is, as height increased there was a corresponding significant increase in VC (standing). This supported the hypothesis that VC (standing) correlated with the other parameters. A possible reason for this could be that due to an increased height, the thoracic cavity of the individual could be larger and he/she could have larger lungs having a greater capacity and space for increased air volumes. In another study, it was found that height could be used to predict VC accurately (Parma et al., 1995). Considering height could accurately predict VC, height would have to strongly correlate with VC to make that prediction. This correlation between VC and height was also found in this study with Principles of Biology students.  

VC (standing) (L) and resting heart beats per minute showed no correlation, meaning that as resting heart beats per minute increased there was no corresponding definite increase or decrease in VC (standing). This did not support the hypothesis that VC (standing) correlated with the other parameters; therefore, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. An underlying reason for why resting heart beats per minute did not impact VC (standing) can be that since heart rate is the rate at which oxygen is transported to and from the heart, it would have no correlation to how much air can be inhaled and exhaled from the lungs. It has been found in past studies that there was a correlation between heart beats per minute and VC (Zou et. al., 2017), but this study focused on already ill individuals. The current study focused on healthy 17 to 34 year olds, thus having no underlying medical issue that could have impacted the results like the study mentioned before. 

There was also a positive correlation between chest circumference (cm) and VC (standing) (L). This meant that as chest circumference increased there was a corresponding increase in VC (standing). This supported the hypothesis that VC (standing) correlated with the other parameters. A possible reason for this could be, similarly to increased height, due to an increased chest circumference, the thoracic cavity would be larger and the individual could have larger lungs due to the extra space. This would allow for a greater capacity and space for increased air volume. A study trying to discover if ethnic differences in lung function could be explained by chest size found that the influence of chest circumference was trivial and did not impact their results (Whittaker et. al., 2004). This differed from the results found in this study considering there was a correlation found between chest circumference and VC. The reason for this difference could be that in the study mentioned, children ages ranging from 6-11 years old were used. Individuals in this age range would not have reached their maximum VC limit as yet, while in this study, students with ages ranging from 17-34 years old were used and would have reached maximum VC. This age difference between the two studies could account for the difference between the two. 

There was also a relationship that could be found between VC and gender. Females had an overall lower average VC, both standing and sitting, than the males. This showed that males had higher lung capacity than females. This could be due to the fact that the males had also a higher average height to females causing them to have a larger thoracic cavity and lungs. This same result was found in a study in 2015. It was found that males tended to have an increased VC to females (Youssef et. al., 2015). This same finding was found when observing the subjects of this study. When regarding smoking and athleticism, there was no strong correlation found between the two and VC, respectively. First of all, there were only two smokers in the whole sample, which was not enough to objectively observe if there was a positive or negative correlation between it and VC. Athleticism also could not be determined if it impacted VC because, like smoking, there were not many student athletes. Also, type of athlete was not specified; therefore, an individual could have not been at their best, training wise, at the time the experiment was done. 

These findings show that, overall, height, chest circumference, and gender had the most impact on VC. This could show that bigger chest cavities in general would result in a higher VC. In future studies this finding should be looked at more in depth across more age groups. A study focusing on smoking and athleticism should be conducted since the sample size for this particular study was not sufficient to make a conclusion regarding those two.
