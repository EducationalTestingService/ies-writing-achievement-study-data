Topic: Third World themes permeating in our own society today, Junot Diaz "The Dreamer":
Thesis Statement: People, no matter where they are in the world, would risk anything and everything to achieve their dream, even when all odds are against them.

Outline:
Intro:
People risking it all for a dream (to a certain extent)
Not really a 1st world problem; we have more freedom
Mainly 3rd world issue; people living with persecution for pursuing a dream
BUT even in the U.S., a land where "you can be what you want to be"/ "dreams come true", still not promised for minorities that their dreams will come true
Dreams couldn’t come true in their homeland(s), probably won't come true in the states either
P. 1: (Diaz's mother):
Dictator (General Rafael Trujillo) passed a mandatory education act for all Dominican kids under 15 yrs old must attend school instead of work; violations end in imprisonment
Risked her health for an education; "...because a seven-year-old girl up in the hills of Azua knelt before a puddle, found courage in herself and drank."
Lost family members to get an education; she got her mother (Diaz's grandmother) arrested!
Made sacrifices for her to achieve her dream, only for it to be shot down when she came to the states (immigration, no mastery in English)
P. 2: (minorities in the states today):
Anyone can reach their goals in the USA! As long as you were born here, speak perfect English, no threatening cultural background, are male, and white
The govt/system is set against us/POC
They will try their damnedest hardest to make the journey a struggle for us; throwing any and every hurdle into our way vs a white male and they call it an "even race"
We have to work 3x as hard just to get half of what they got
This doesn’t mean achieving our dreams isn't possible; it is
We can't give up; we must be persistent; use what resources we have available and take the ones "they" don’t give to us; outsmart them
P. 3: (aftermath):
Aftermath can be + or - ; depends on how we work for it
Must put in our 100% at all times
Work to inspire others; use those negatives/obstacles as motivation
Don’t let what your obstacles overcome you
Your future depends on YOU  
Conclusion:
At times, risking to lose it all, or what's important, to reach a goal/dream, is necessary 
Push yourself to tolerable limits to get what you want
