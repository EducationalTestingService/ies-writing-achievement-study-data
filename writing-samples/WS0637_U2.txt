On Being Brought from Africa to America 

	In my opinion, On Being Brought from Africa to America has the tone of being very Empathetic or even impassioned. In the poem it says that the speaker was brought from their Pegan land. In my opinion, I think that they came from a godless country and now they are being brought to America where Christianity is real popular. I also believe that the speaker changes her religion once they got to America. The speaker of the poem starts to say that there is a god and that it is their savior. Later the speaker starts to describe how African American and the color of their skin is looked down upon. The speaker then says,” Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.” I think that they’re trying to say that it doesn’t matter what the color of your skin is. If you are a Christian, you will always go to heaven. I think that the tone of the poem is very Empathetic in that the speaker is very understanding in the changes that are happening their life.  The change for Africa to America is a really big change. The change from believing in no go to actually believing in a god is also a very big change. The speaker understands that they are going to have to adapt and change things about themselves. The tone also feels very impassioned. The speaker is obviously going to be filled with different emotions with all the changes that they are going through at this time. Being African American in this time period was hard and could make the speaker feel depressed at times. The speaker could also feel happy that they found a religion that is good for them. Tone can make each reader feel or see something different, but I thing that Phillis Wheatley mad the poem this way for a reason.
