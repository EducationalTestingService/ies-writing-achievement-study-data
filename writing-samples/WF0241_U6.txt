Peer and Instructor Introduction Blog Post Due Aug 18,2017
Hello, my name is Sam Doe, but I prefer to be called Sam. I grew up in Anytown most of my life and moved to Anyville per my dadâ€™s orders from the military. I am new to a university setting because I have only done community college classes. My goal for this course is to become a better business writer than I was when I took a class at coastal. I want to learn how to be short and concise with my messages and not use long paragraphs to get my point across. I do not like writing papers, so this class will be very great for me. The type of business I want to study besides the core requirements is Accounting, I have always been fascinated with the field and am always ready to learn more things about it. I have an affinity for numbers and money, everything I buy is (mostly) calculated on a need/want basis. For example, I need a car to get back and forth to class and my other obligations. However, I want an Nintendo Switch. Which is more important? Obviously, the car (I do own one). So, the things I want, I write down and see how long it will take me to save for it. I also invest into my employments 401k and stock program. Not only that I do have other securities such as CDs and other stocks. I love to watch the stock market. I catch on very quick to accounting concepts from the first class I took which was entry level to advanced classes. Business writing in the field I want to study in will help me get to the point faster because time equals money in this world and I do not want my boss to waste his or her time reading a document with fluff. Quick and to the point is what I hope to aim for. This will take some time for me to get used too though because I have only taken English research classes that required 5 to 10-page papers a semester. Also, I hope this class will help me be more concise with my language and wording as well.  I look forward to this class and what it brings. -Sam
