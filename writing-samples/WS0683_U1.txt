Puritanism Versus Enlightenment





	The idea of Puritanism was first introduced in the late sixteenth and seventeenth century by a group of English. Puritanism is based off the way a person feels rather than how they think. The Enlightenment is based off how people think about their faith. Determining whether faith is absence of thought is not difficult when comparing Puritanism and the Enlightenment. 

	Puritanism was introduced before Enlightenment and before they had any access to technology. The Puritans based their faith off the way they felt about God. They were thought to believe that they felt God’s presence in them and that is how they based their faith. Puritanism has a more moral based approach as opposed to the Enlightenment. They practiced moral purity to the smallest detail. Puritanism is absent of thought because it all based on feeling. Mary Rowlandson and Anne Bradstreet were thought to be very moral and good Christians who based their faith off the Puritans idea of faith. They each said that they felt God’s presence in them. They did not believe that man could be morally perfect. 

	The Enlightenment faith is more based off thought and science. They prefer to know the facts and to believe what science can prove to them. They used their advancement in technology to determine facts that they could test and see rather than what they felt. The Enlightenment believed in the perfectibility of man. They believed in man’s mind not God’s word. 

	In conclusion, the idea of puritanism is solely based off feeling faith instead of thinking about it. The Enlightenment is based off thinking and science. They believe in hard facts instead of their feelings. Puritanism is absence of thought and Enlightenment is not.
