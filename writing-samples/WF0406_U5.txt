Materials and Methods
The vital capacity was measured in liters within a group of Principles of Biology students from a local university, laboratory sections L54, L55, L56, and 03C. The total number of students that participated, (n), was 96 students,  of whom 71 were females and 25 males. Ranging in age from 17 to 34 years old. Each student measured his/her standing and sitting VC in triplicate. The averages per student were found for both standing and sitting VC trials. 

The other factors studied that could affect VC were the students individual measurements of chest circumference (cm), height (cm), and resting pulse rate. The chest circumference was measured with a tape measure and height using a meter stick. After sitting and resting for 10 minutes, the resting pulse rate was measured by placing the index and middle fingers of one hand on the radial artery of the other arm and counting the number of pulses in a 15 second duration. The 15 second duration was timed using a MyChron stopwatch. Resting pulse rate was taken in three replicates, averaged and multiplied by 4 to determine the average number of heartbeats per minute. Each student also recorded his/her age, sex, whether a smoker or a non-smoker, and an athlete or a non-athlete. The statistical analysis used to analyze the data for any relationship/correlation between VC and the other parameters recorded was Correlation analysis.
