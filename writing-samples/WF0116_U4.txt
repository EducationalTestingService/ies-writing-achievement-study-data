In today’s society, speaking a different language is one of the factors that triggers racism and discrimination. However, some people may not know that multilingualism strengthens the brain in various ways. Research shows that people who are multilingual tend to have a better-developed brain than monolinguals. Both hemispheres of the brain work in a greater manner when the person is bilingual, and even more when the person is multilingual. The effects of being multilingual consist of a better short and long-term memory, better decision-making skills, and better ability to sustain concentration, all thanks to the greater use of gray matter. All these factors are compiled under the cognitive abilities and skills, which are the abilities and skills of processing information in the human brain. These skills help the multilingual person delay Alzheimer’s for plenty of years, as well as opening various job opportunities in the workforce, and how to respond to different situations.
