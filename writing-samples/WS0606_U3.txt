Reflection

The portfolio contains a part of my work as a student and english learner. All the sources were supporting my view towards education and to the needs of schools in America. Many American schools are needing the most help comes from low income neighborhoods, the thing that this is not new. This problem had affected many youngs and kids that live in  a capitalist country.



Going through my writing I realized that education lacks were a issue for me. And still being one of the reasons that many students quit. Many American schools need a better found to build or renew their facilities, founds that are always limited. The governments is concerned about things of less interest and limit the support for certain areas of the country. Anyways I’m surprise of the slow reaction from the community leaders, or may be their voice doesn’t reach to that area of the government.



Having a high level education means learning a lot in the process, that could bring the professionals of the future giving chance to develop new performance. College and private universities have the most respected classes and professionals, writers, singers, poets, politicians, etc. But again the classes are required to be pay to be there, it would be easier for a lot students that doesn’t  the money, to have it free. That would support them a lot and won’t need to worried about paying for school. 



When I started college I felt like I didn’t learn much about writing in my high school, because college goes beyond with writing. Now that I’m writing is better because what I had learned. I still need to learn a lot, but I still feeling the pressure that teachers put to students when they start. Very soon I would be writing a lot better. For now I applied to my writing what teachers asked for, the classes are important and make students successful.
