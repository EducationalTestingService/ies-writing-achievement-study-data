Out of all of the authors that we covered, Mary Rowlandson was my favorite. I enjoyed reading her story, “A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration.” This story illustrated how she grew up in  hard times. These hard times made her seek after God in order to find peace in her life. This peace was not only for herself but for the Indians holding her captive as well. Rowlandson’s demeanor and attitude was shaped by the way the Indians treated her. The Wampanoag Indians would take the prisoners that they captured in there raids and sell them as slaves. Rowlandson was allowed to live among them and see what kind of people they were. She called them savages when she was first captured. As time goes on, she is slowly transformed by God. She eventually accepts the Wampanoag Indians for what the really are. She is amazed that God could provide for her enemy in such a vast wilderness. She realizes that we are all a creations of God.
