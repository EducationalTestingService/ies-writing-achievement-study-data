Andrew's position and or purpose for writing was to inform her readers about some stereotyping that occurs in data aggregation. Another purpose for Andrew's writing was to tell us why some laws need to be put in place on these issues. Andrew gives a few examples that supports her position on writing. One example from the text on stereotyping she stated that your application could be declined on the basis of aggregate data meaning what other people who likes and dislikes are similar to yours have done. One important example she stated was when an Atlanta man returned from his honeymoon and found his credit limit been lowered. But the switch was not on anything he had did but on the aggregate data. The letter from the company have told him that old customers who used their cards have a poor repayment history with the American Express.
My position on the issue is that advertisers are limiting people on roles society really expects them to play. I do believe laws are necessary especially in data aggregation because it can allow people to know what websites really knows about them. For example, one law can be allowing people to get false information in credit reports. Most importantly a law I think should be enforced just like how Andrew stated is a do not track law.
