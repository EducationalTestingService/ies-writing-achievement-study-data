Karate and Me
It was summer 2015, I was at the annual Superfights competition lined up ready to start. I was wearing my white gi top (karate uniform) and no shoes. The room was cold but filled with love. Our head instructor gave the command and we were ready to start the day. We bowed in and proceeded onto the black belt presentation. They called us up to the front and we line up to receive our new degrees. I was moving on to second degree and it felt amazing.
The amount of work I had put into receiving my second degree made it even more worth it. There’s a waiting period between each degree so I had waited a year to test for second degree after I got my first degree and from second to third it’s a 2 year wait and so on and so forth. I had to attend a certain amount of classes and even keep my school grades up on top of playing football. To say the least I had a lot of things going on but somehow, I made it work. Along with hard work and dedication, receiving my second degree or any black belt degree comes responsibility. 
A lot more is expected out of black belts than any other belts. The reason behind that is we are held to a higher standard because we are higher in rank. The kids in class look up to us as their leaders and some people don’t realize that kids watch every move you make. It has changed the way I act and feel about things. Karate teaches a lot of discipline and patience and it has helped me in more ways than one, especially with my temper. It has also helped me be slow to anger and think things through rather than act out immediately. It makes me mellow and able to find my happy place and even have a better demeanor. The peace of concentration, determination, and meditation is what drives me every day and I have karate to thank for that.
