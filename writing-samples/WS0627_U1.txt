No, faith is most certainly not an absence of thought. As Puritans we understand that to understand God’s divine will we must be well versed in more than just scripture. Puritans are challenged to study and understand topics such as: natural phenomena, human history, and current events. One cannot even begin to understand such topics without the ability to think. In fact, some of the smartest, most well-educated people are devout Christians. Take Jonathan Edwards for example. This minister was a leader of the Great Awakening and entered Yale college at just the age of 13 years old. So, to assume that just because one has faith in an all-powerful God that they do not posses the ability to think is incoherently wrong and shows one’s ignorance. 

	Yes, to have blind faith in some sort of God is most certainly an absence of thought. As enlightened individuals one believes in “an emphasis on reason instead of authority.” This statement focusses on the idea that man’s mind is the highest power and not God’s word. Also, if someone has absolute faith one cannot reach the perfectibility of man while still believing that all men are corrupt and therefore, can never reach one’s highest potential. Some of America’s greatest minds, such as Benjamin Franklin, have become enlightened and reached their highest potential because they have not been held back by focusing on and spending time on their faith. Instead they spend time attempting to create and build new things and spread their knowledge.
