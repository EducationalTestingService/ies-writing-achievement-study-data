An applied mathematician is a specific type of mathematician and can be labeled as a subcategory, so many of the duties of an applied mathematician are shared with a mathematician.  These duties may include creating and theorizing new ideas and concepts to possibly change how certain problems can be done, determining the verifiability of a proposed idea by another person, using math to solve issues that other fields may have, creating graphs and other models to examine information, analyze data and come to a conclusion based off of the analysis, and more.  Every subcategory of mathematician carries all of these responsibilities but there are specific characteristics to each one that separate them from the rest.  More specifically, applied mathematicians focus mainly on solving problems and coming up with solutions for other individual in another area of study.  In short, applied mathematicians are the math side to any problem that needs to be solved.  Whether it be a business who needs someone to help with accounting and financing issues, or a physicist who needs help understanding a particular problem, or an engineer who needs someone to help them out with some the intricate mathematical details and design flaws.  If someone needs math to be done, they call the applied mathematician, as they are not bound to one organization or business but rather are utilized in a variety of environments.  
    Most information and research done on applied mathematics focus mostly on mathematics as a whole so the following information on salaries more closely relate to all mathematics branches instead of specifically focusing on applied mathematics.  Salary can range from as little as $56.000 to as high as $153,000.  The salary can vary based off of a number of things, like years of experience, locations, individual skill, and employer.  The employers who pay most are those in science, manufacturing, government, business management, and schools.
