Trifles Essay	

Susan Glaspell chooses to title her play Trifles, in the Dictionary trifles can be defined as “a thing of little value or importance”.  As you read you can see many little examples that can be described as trifles, but Glaspell title can also be described to the women’s role in her play and the time the play was set in. In late 1800 to early 1900, when this play was performed women were still thought of as lesser. Many people thought women should only stay at home and take care of the house and children. They believed women could not do to the role of men and were never thought of as equal. Mrs. Wrights character in the play trifles describes the role of women during the times well with many examples. One example can be found when Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters are mocked by the sheriff for talking about how Mrs. Wright had knitted. This is just a small example of how some men mocked the roles of women of that time. While looking through the house Mrs. Wright was Criticized for the way her house is not clean. This is an example that women were expected to be the ones to do all the chores. If those two examples are not good enough to describe the role of women, then take a look at how Mrs. Wrights life was described before and after marriage in the play. Many times, Mrs. Hale would call Mrs. Wright by Minnie Foster to describe her past. This would symbolize that as a teen she was a completely different person and was much happier before she was forced into the role of women in that time. Glaspell story was about a murder, but the story did much more than break down a mystery of who really did the killing.
