Is Faith an Absence of Thought?

Faith, the most important thing a person can have and it should not require thought but feeling instead. The existence of a supreme being should be like the existence of radiation, though we may not see the physical embodiment of God we see his effects surrounding us every day. Thinking isn’t a factor but feeling the existence in the one true God and seeing his effects and power in every day life and feeling it every time the church doors open. That is Faith, knowing something is there without having the physical ability to touch it and see it. All worldly things and knowledge should not matter in comparison with one’s faith. Church and God should be the most important things in one’s life and for those that use thought opposed to feeling I’m in great fear for their souls.

Faith requires thought, thinking allows man to gain knowledge and therefor understand things better. If man focused more on thinking we may be able to understand God and his plans better. Without thinking we could not advance science and gain more understanding of the universe and its surroundings. We should focus on what we know is physically here and bring mankind to the perfect pinnacle instead of wasting our time in churches listening to preachers talk about fire and brimstone. In the end we would find much more out by using our intellect and progress our understanding of God further as well as taking steps towards perfecting ourselves as a species.
