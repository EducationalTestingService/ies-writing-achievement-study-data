In the essay “Facebook is Using You” Andrews explains why she opposes data collecting technologies such as facebook. She talks about how in certain countries there are laws that allow people to find out the data collected from them. Such laws do not exist in America, so Andrews believes laws should be established for others’ privacy. In her essay she states,” The bits and bytes of a your life can be used against you. Whether it's obtaining a job, credit or insurance,it all based on your digital doppelganger. You would never know why you were turned down.” Whatever you do on the internet reflects yourself, and jobs pick you based on the data collected from data collection technologies. In Andrews' essay "Facebook is Using You", her purpose was to inform readers of the danger of data collection technologies such as Facebook.
 

            I believe that laws against data collection do not exist in America because people would try to create false profiles about themselves based on the information being collected. People post a lot of personal things on the internet. I think people should be taught about the dangers of what is being posted rather than what is being collected. Data collection is not all bad, and can often have good use. In the essay she states” Material mined online has been used against people battling for child custody.” Base on the data collected people are able to determine who a child is safer with based on the stuff posted online. Data collection may have some bad outcomes, but because of some of the good outcomes I do not see a problem with it.
