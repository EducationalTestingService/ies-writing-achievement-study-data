Hello everyone!

My name is Sam Doe, but you can call me Sam. I’m a student from Anytown (Any country).  My degree back in Anytown is International Business, but here I will do a major of Finance. I think that “Writing for Career Essentials” is very important as everybody should know how to write in a proper way, adapting the level of language to the contest and the people you are writing to.

I guess we will learn how to write in a formal way, as this will prepare us for our future job environment. I believe that the way you write can determine whether you get a job or not, or whether you secede in a negotiation with a partner. It is very important to put the correct words in the correct place. Also having a wide vocabulary can help the writing skills as you can express yourselves in a more accurate way and write exactly what you are thinking. Being clear and making a visual structure when writing is essential.  Without learning all this we could end up in misunderstandings or lack of professionalism.

I am sure that after this course we will be able and ready to produce a high quality work in terms of writing. This will help us for our future jobs for sure .It will definitely be very helpful as well for the rest of our subject during our studies at our university, as in most of them we need to do paper works and other kind of written projects. I am sure teacher will appreciate the quality of the writing of this works and take it into consideration when deciding the grade that our work deserves.

To sum up, “Writing for Career Essentials” will be crucial for our future written works and will help us express ourselves in a better and more appropriate way.
