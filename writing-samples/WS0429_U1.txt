Double Standard 


Although men and women are conceived the same, carried in a womb, and evicted from their mother's body, there is always a battle between the sexes. While men can have multiple sex partners and are considered "the man," women who have multiple sex partners are considered promiscuous. When women have insufficient funds and are unable to take care of their children, they are supported with government funding; meanwhile, men who have the same issue either get put on child support or go to jail, or sometimes both. When a male wants to wear fake hair, it's is considered gay, weird, and unusual; when a female wants to wear fake hair, it is considered a protective style, gorgeous, and is seen as normal. It is often considered normal for a woman to have household duties and are often considered "housewives", while men are supposed to go to work and bring in a source of income; yet, the breadwinner moms and stay-at-home dads are looked at as distorted.
