From August 28 to September 1, 2017, Vital Capacity (VC) was measured by a group of University Principles of Biology students, laboratory section L54, L55, L56 and 03A. The students who took Principles of Biology were used as subjects (homo sapiens). The total number of students who participated in the spirometry study was 96 (that is n, which was the sample size = 96). The number of females was 71, males was 25, and ranging in age between 17 to 34 years old. Three replicates of VC were measured by each subject in the sitting and standing position, respectively. Liters (L) was used as the unit of measurement for VC. Also, the averages of VC were determined for both positions. 
The other three parameters (chest circumferences, height and resting pulse rate) were measured by each subject using a tape measure and meter stick, respectively. Centimeters (cm) was used as the unit of measurement. Resting pulse rate was measured by placing the index and middle fingers of one hand on the radial artery of the other arm and counting the number of pulse beats in 15 seconds using MyChron stopwatch. Three replicates of resting pulse rate were taken and the resting pulse rate per one-minute was determined by multiplying 4 by the average number of pulse beats in 15 seconds. Each student also recorded his or her age, sex and whether he or she was a smoker or non-smoker, and an athlete or a non-athlete. The Correlation Analysis was used to analyze the data for any relationship between VC and their height, heartbeats per minute and chest circumferences as a statistical analysis.
