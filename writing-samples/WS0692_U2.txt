When I started reading Thomas Paineâ€™s Age of Reason the two main emotions I experienced were confusion with a touch of frustration. As a Muslim who believes in God and believes that the Prophet Muhammad was the Messenger of God, I cannot fully comprehend some of his facts that he uses to back up his argument. Paine mentions that he does not believe that the Quran was sent to Muhammad by an Angel, because he was not there, and he did not see it firsthand. According to our beliefs the Prophet did not know how to read or write so the only way he could have gotten the revelation was if the Angel gave it to him from God. I guess I am having a hard time understanding where he is coming from because this is something I have believed my whole life and I have faith in my God and what was revealed in the Quran. 

	As someone who considers herself a strong and faithful Muslim woman, it makes me confused when he talks about how the religion that I feel so strongly for is, in his eyes, false theology. Since I am giving the point of view as a Muslim, it probably frustrates the Christians at the time that this work was published a lot more drastically. He rejected the Church as well as the beliefs in miracles. It frustrates me because he is rejecting something that I can see so clearly: The miracles of God.
