Compare and Contrast Paragraph



		The comparison of high school to college is one that commonly happens primarily by college students. The reality of high school is you are coming towards adulthood while parents, teachers, coaches guide you, and school counselors to become the person society wants you to be. While in college you are guided by what you believe you want out of life. The other absolute comparison is the majority of the time high school is free, but college is expensive, so the amount of effort put into college differs vastly compared to the effort put into high school. The similarities are mass in the comparison also. The fact that they are academic institutions that prepare students for the most issues in life and help shape them as people is what they have in common.
