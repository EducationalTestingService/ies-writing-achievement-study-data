Favorite Author 

	Out of all the authors we discussed in American literature this semester my favorite author would probably be Thomas Paine. Thomas Paine wrote “The Age of Reason” and “Common Sense”. I am a really big fan of this time period and both of the works played a big roll in American history. Thomas Paine was even considered The Father of the American Revolution. Common Sense advocated independence from Great Britain and The Age of Reason argued for the philosophical position of Deism. Thomas Paine was never afraid to say what was on his mind in his writings. I have always been a fan of American History but Thomas Paine was definitely my favorite author throughout this semester.
