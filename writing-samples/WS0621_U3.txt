why "Trifles?"  Just like any other title, there is a reason behind this play being named “Trifles”. Before even reading this play, we received background information on the playwright and learned that she was a feminist that used her plays to empower women. After learning this information, I could assume that the play title would be related to women in some way. Once i read the play it confirmed this assumption to be true. Early in the play one of the male roles said, “Well women are use to worrying about trifles” and this quote pointed out how men of the time thought of women. The play started off with the focus on the men only and the women were off to the side saying nothing. The women seemed to be considered unimportant and unable to add anything of intelligence to the conversation or the investigation. Once the men left to further their investigation the focus shifted to the women. The women were collecting things to bring to the deceased man’s wife while she was in prison. Even with the onstage focus being on the women, any time the men would come back onto the stage the men would minimize and dismiss anything the women were speaking of as irrelevant. An example of this was when the men entered the stage and the women were questioning how the wife was going to finish a quilt, hearing this men just laughed but they did not know that the women just came upon a piece of evidence proving the wife was distraught or nervous while sewing. By the end of the play the women had found multiple pieces of evidence, proving they were more than just “trifles” and kept this evidence from the the men of the play.
