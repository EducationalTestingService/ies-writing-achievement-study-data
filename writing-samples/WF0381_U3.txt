This is a world where marriage is a big part of life. One day I will want a husband, but what am I looking for in a husband?  
     I want a husband to be the breadwinner and take care of the home financially. That means work as late as you want so you can make sure you support me and the kids. Since you are the breadwinner, you get to make final decisions. I want a husband to listen to my side of a debate, fully understand, then decide the final resolution, no matter how passionate I fell about the situation. I want a husband to complain to me about things that go wrong then get upset when I feel bold enough to do the same.  
     I want a husband that fix car cars and do plumbing. When we get books, build a bookshelf because I simply cannot do such a thing. I want a husband who, in the middle of the night, wakes me up to change diapers and comfort our kids when they have nightmares. You need to get as much sleep as possible for work the next day. I want a husband who doesn’t do household duties. This means letting me clean the house and wash dishes and nobody else. You shouldn’t have to wash dishes because you will not cook. I want a husband who is afraid of the kitchen. Leave it to me to cook the meals, while you play video games.  
     I want a husband who doesn't show emotions. If somebody dies, don’t cry, if you get a raise, don’t smile, and if you are hurting, don’t show pain. I want a husband where the gym is his best friend. You have to be strong and muscular so you can lift heavy things like a table or a chair. Most importantly, I want a husband to tell me what to do. You want a sandwich? You got it. You want a massage? You got it. Don’t be afraid to do such a thing because you are in charge of this marriage.  
     If I can find somebody with all of my requirements, my life would be complete. The perfect husband, right?
