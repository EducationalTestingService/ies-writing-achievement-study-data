Materials and Methods
Vital capacity (VC), measured in liters (L), was recorded in a group of University Principles of Biology. Students included in the study were from laboratory sections L54, L55, L56, and 03C. The entire sample size was ninety-six students, twenty-five males and seventy-one females. The students ages ranged between eighteen and thirty-four. The subjects measured his/her VC using a Phipps and Bird 9 Liter Wet Spirometer. The subjects recorded their VC in both a standing and a sitting supine position. After doing three replicates in each position, the average for each respective position was calculated. 
Other factors that can affect VC were also measured and recorded, such as height (cm), chest circumference (cm), and resting pulse rate (bpm). Height was recorded using a meter stick, and chest circumference was recorded using a tape measure. Each subject, after resting for ten minutes, measured his/her resting pulse by placing the index and middle fingers of one arm on the radial artery of the other arm. Subjects recorded the number of pulses felt for fifteen seconds, timed on a MyChron stopwatch, in a total of three sets. The average pulses for the three sets was then calculated and multiplied by four to get the resting pulse rate for one minute. Subjects also recorded gender, age, chest circumference and whether or not they were smokers or athletes. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the data.
