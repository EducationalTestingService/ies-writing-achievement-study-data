 “Trifles” by Susan Glaspell the role of women has little importance. The word “Trifles” itself means little importance. Women only talk among each other in the play while men are outside doing things. Women do not talk to the men very much and they are often separate in the play. In the play, a man was killed. The men are out looking for evidence and the women are inside simply talking to one another. Even if the women find something inside the house that could possibly be a piece of evidence, they do not tell the men. This means they probably feel like they do not feel anything they see as important, or the men might not believe them, or maybe it is simply not their place to speak. The men can not figure out what happened or who killed the man, but I believe if the women would have told them things they noticed the mystery could have been solved. The men do not know what the women know, and the women do not know what the men know. If they would work together they could solve what happened. The women might even feel that things they found do not mean anything or have little importance, which is another example of a trifle in the play. If everyone would think that they matter, and every little thing in the house matters, then they could solve the mystery of who killed the man. Everything and everyone in life is important for some reason and people need to realize that. “Trifles” or things that have little importance should not be the case for this sort of thing. In the play, they even might have thought the man that died was not important at times.
