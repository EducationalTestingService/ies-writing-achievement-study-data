Facebook Is Using You
Lori Andrew’s purpose for writing her essay, “Facebook Is Using You”, was to warn her readers of the potential threats data-collection technologies can cause for web users. Andrew’s essay is structured as a argumentative/persuasive essay so she uses examples that includes research done on specific websites or social media that is highly known. One example she uses that includes a research reads, “Google took in more than ten times as much, with an estimated $36.5 billion in advertising revenue in 2011, by analyzing what people sent over Gmail and what they searched on the web, and then using that data to sell ads.” This example highlights how data-collection technologies uses our personal information without our consent to sell ads. This poses as a threat to web users who use Google and Gmail which at the end ties into Andrew’s purpose of writing this essay, to help protect her readers.

My position on Andrew’s essay is that I have been persuaded about how data-collection technologies are a potential threat to web users, and I for one use the web a lot so I agree with Andrew’s point of view. Laws are necessary because they protect us from things like danger, Identify theft, or even our privacy. In Andrew’s essay, she gives an example of how advertisers monitor our daily activities on the web and it reads, “In 2007 and 2008, the online advertising company NeBuAd contacted with six Internet service providers to install hardware on their networks that monitored users Internet activities and transmitted that data to NeBuAd’s servers for analysis and use in marketing. For an average of six months, NeBuAd copied every e-mail, Web search or purchase that some 400,000-people sent over the Internet.” This shows how easily our personal information is exposed without our knowledge, which in the end can be dangerous.
