Puritan: Faith is not an absence of thought. I think faith is believing in something and it is something you can only feel. You cannot express the feeling of faith but it is very much real and not an absence of thought. Some examples that support this would be of past Puritan descriptions of faith. Mostly all the puritans would say that you can feel something when you have faith in God. Also, no one could describe the feeling. It is a feeling that you cannot express but is there. Faith also requires you to think so it is not an absence of thought. Many people read the Bible and think about how the things being said happened. Faith is not an absence of thought.



Enlightenment: Faith is an absence of thought. How can someone feel something without being able to express what they are feeling. All the other feelings besides faith you can express how it makes you feel. That is one reason why I think faith is an absence of thought. Another reason is that you are not thinking for yourself. Someone is just telling you all these things about how something happened and you are supposed to believe it and not think for yourself.
