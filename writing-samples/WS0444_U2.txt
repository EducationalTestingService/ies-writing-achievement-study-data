Henrietta Lacks1  





HeLa comes from Henrietta’s name, Doctors named her cells after her when they discovered that she had cervical cancer. Her cells were cells that continued to grow on and on, which made Henrietta the first African American woman to have cells that grew and expanded as much as hers did.



Doctors called Henrietta “Helen Lane” or “Helen Larson”. I believe they didn’t know her true name for so long because her family didn’t really speak up that much about who Henrietta was (her background, family history, etc.). 



HeLa cells could wrap around the earth at least three times spanning more than 350 million feet.



The cytoplasm, and the nucleus. 



Henrietta Lacks died from cervical cancer, when she died doctors took cells from her body without her or anyone related to her knowing. Before her death surgeon dilated her cervix and prepared to treat her tumor. They did this get a follow up and to actually see what they would be working with to possibly know what to expect. 



The main issue from Lacks family was basically them not being aware that Henrietta still had cells that existed. They didn’t like the fact that her cells were floating around for years making money, but they didn’t have any of the money.
