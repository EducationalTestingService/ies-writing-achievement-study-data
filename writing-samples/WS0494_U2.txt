Topic Interests:
The topic I have chosen is the use of patients and medical subjects that are inappropriate despite the benefits it has brought about. The reason why I have chosen this topic is to gain more knowledge on how important informed consent is. There's been many occasions on why African Americans do not like going to the doctors for a check up. African Americans are afraid of being used for research without their consent and come back home sicker than ever. Throughout history African American where secretly used as guinea pigs for medical research by various American governments.

Research Procedures:
Some research strategies that I need to pursue is try looking at different types of
experiments, theories,and researches.I can also use interviews,documentaries and
documentations to gain a good amount of information. Besides the internet and the public library, I will be looking at newspapers, magazines, printed articles that contain the information I need for my research. Newspapers and magazines are heavily vetted before being put out so the information would be accurate

Purpose and Claim:
The purpose of my research is to g on why African Americans are
the only race that was being used for experiments without their consents. My preliminary thesis is; Medical subjects that inappropriately use African Americans patients for medical research abuses their human rights, invades their privacy, and exposes them to harmful diseases
