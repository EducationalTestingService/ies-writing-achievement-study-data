Going to fight the dragon alone was not the right choice for Beowulf to make. He knew that the battle would most likely end in his death, as most of his men had turned and fled from the sight of the dragon. In going ahead, he not only left his kingdom without an established king or plan for the future, but he also stripped them of the protection his reputation provided. After his death, Wiglaf, the one man who remained by Beowulf’s side, chastised the other men saying, “Every one of you with freeholds of land, our whole nation will be dispossessed, once princes from beyond get tidings of how you turned and fled and disgraced yourselves” (102).  Despite his men fleeing, Beowulf persisted, seeking eternal glory through fame and renown. He was obviously not as concerned for his subjects as his reputation for being a fair and just king would suggest.  Perhaps that is why his men ran from the dragon instead of standing with him. Perhaps they did not feel the true pull of comitatus because they understood that their king was only concerned with his final reputation. Indeed, he did go out in a “blaze of glory” by defeating the dragon, but at what cost? Despite Beowulf’s obvious lack of concern for his kingdom, at his death his subject’s still grieved for him saying, “That of all the kings upon the Earth, he was the man most gracious and fair-minded, kindest to his people, and keenest to win fame” (108). One may draw from this ending that, at least in his subjects’ eyes, he was a hero unto death
