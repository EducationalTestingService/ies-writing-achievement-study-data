The Puritan does not have an absence of thought when it comes to faith. Puritans believed that as long as they believed in God then that faith would carry them through life. Even though they cannot see God, as long as they worked hard and followed christian rules, they would go to heaven. Serving God was the main purpose of life. All Puritans are taught christian values at an early age. The Puritans were almost brainwashed in a sense. This type of brainwashing requires no thought for the practice of the Puritan faith. It is obvious that faith is not an absence of thought. 

Living in the enlightenment era was a very troubled and energetic time. New ideas were shaping the world. Books were being published faster due to the invention of the printing press. Along with these new thought patterns was disease and famine. The Bubonic plague along with influenza had claimed many lives.The Church had just came through troubled times due to the crusade wars. The human faith was being tested daily. People in this time were not putting their faith in the hands of the church clergy. The church had failed most of the population through corruption. People were searching inside themselves to find answers of why bad things were happening to them. Whenever there is struggle most people turn to God to help bring them out of turmoil. Due to the new ideas of christianity during this era, the Enlightened people would agree that faith is an absence of thought.
