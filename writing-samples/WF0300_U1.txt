Critical Writing is a form of writing where the writer must evaluate information in order to write a thoughtful essay. It is a verb.

Critical can be broken down into two parts, criticus, which is of latin origin, and critic which is of english origin. This created the word critical to describe an outbreak of diseases. It has since been altered to show the meaning that most know today as “an analysis of merits” from our friends at dictionary.com. Writing can be broken into two parts as well, writan, which is an old english or germanic word, and reissen, which is german. These were put together to make a word that meant “to score with letters through sketch” also according to dictionary.com. When putting the two separate words together though, we see the analysis and the writing, which leads me to believe that critical writing’s true definition is to analyze something thoroughly, and write and educated piece on that topic.

Critical writing is not a normal type of writing. It does not come from the heart in most cases, and is not thrown together without facts. In critical writing we must dig deeper into the work of text we are analyzing, find hidden meanings within and figure out the author’s intent. We must also allow ourselves to do research outside of the text on the topic to give a broader understanding on it. This way a paper can be written with more thought on the subject. This gives the reader of the critical piece more insight themselves, and will show another perspective on the point.
