Prose v. Poetry
Prose and poetry are similar but easily distinctable. They are both types of literature but there are few similarities beyond that. The two types of literatures have more differences though.
When people think of reading books they are usually referring to the prose style of writing. Prose tells a story whether it is action, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, biographies, autobiographies, comedy, or any other type of prose writing. Prose is always without a specific structure. Prose writing is written in sentences and is usually easily distinctable from poetry with only a glance.
Poetry is used to express feelings, not to tell a story. Emily Dickinson said, "If I read a book and it makes my body so cold no fire ever can warm me, I know that is poetry;". (www.thoughtco.com/) Poetry emphasises certain syllables and meanings of words. It can use rhyme schemes where prose writing never emphasises a specific rhyme scheme.
While these two forms of literature, prose and poetry, are very different, they do have their similarities. Obviously, both are read. Both forms of literature are also forms of entertainment. They both use language to convey meaning and can be on similar or same subjects. They both can use words to draw a mental picture without having to show literal pictures. 
Prose writing and poetry might have their similarities and differences but they can be great in their own ways. Both these writing types can be used to help us emotionally whether it is to calm down or connect with an author over similar feelings and emotions.
