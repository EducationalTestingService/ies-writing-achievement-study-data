In my opinion, “On Being Brought from Africa to America” is Phillis Wheatley’s reflecting about the situation she is currently experiencing. Her tone resembles that of a prisoner that is forced into believing and thinking a certain way. There is an underlying feeling of scornfulness that Wheatly exudes in her writing. Her first line “Twas mercy brought me from my pagan land,” can be read in at least two diverse ways. One can read it as Wheatly appreciating whoever stole her from Africa and sold her or one could read it in the way that she resents those that took her. In my opinion Wheatly’s true meaning is that of resentment towards her slavers. “Once I redemption neither sought nor knew” portrays to the reader how the Christian religion was forced on to her by her owners as she never sought Christ before she was sold as a slave. This can also further the point of Wheatly resenting her owners because of the way they forced her into accepting and knowing the Christian religion without her seeking God on her own. The last four lines of “On Being Brought from Africa to America” reads as if she is speaking to the rest of slave owners that looked at slaves “with scornful eye”. Here she wanted other slave owners to know that just because slaves are of contrasting color than them that they should be allowed to “join the angelic train”. Wheatley’s tone in this poem is overall scornful of the slavers that own her and the poem is full of double entendre.
