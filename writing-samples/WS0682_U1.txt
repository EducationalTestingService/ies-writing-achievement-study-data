 Faith the Absence of Thought?



	Faith is not the absence of thought. Faith is said to be the complete trust in something or someone. My fate is in the hands of God because I have complete faith in him. We all go somewhere after this life on Earth is over, we shall maintain a good life to get into the gates of Heaven when our time comes. Just because we have faith does not mean we are not thinking. You may not be able to hold, smell or touch our faith but it is real. You may see the effects of our faith come to light overtime in the community. You may not understand how a boat floats full of people in the water, but you still get into that boat because you trust it even though you don’t understand how it works. That’s faith.  



	Why should we believe we are sent here to serve a superior being when we are in control of our own destiny? We are all born good, it is the decisions you make throughout your life to determine that. It is our right to question these things you believe if you have no science or logic to back up your theories. Is faith the absence of thought? Yes, just because you tell me something that you read in a book that does not make it the truth. Our minds are our church and that’s who we will serve.
