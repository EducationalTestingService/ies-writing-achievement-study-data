I pondered long on the question of whether “The Wanderer” has a Christian message and I have concluded that it indeed does. As human beings, we sin every single day whether we realize it or not. Jesus died on the cross so that we may be able to repent from those sins and one day rest eternally in Heaven. God shows mercy to His children repeatedly and in the opening lines of the poem readers can see that “the lone-dweller longs for relief, the Almighty’s mercy,” (1-2). Once we were in Sunday school at my church and one of the youth asked if praying was like mediating. The question caused all those present in the room to contemplate and we concluded that it certainly could be. As readers study the following text: “So said the wise man as he sat in meditation” (111), you can certainly perceive that he was indeed praying. God intends for all to abide in Heaven and the speaker acknowledges this when he says, “All shall be well for him who seeks grace, help from our Father in heaven where a fortress stands for us all” (114-115).
