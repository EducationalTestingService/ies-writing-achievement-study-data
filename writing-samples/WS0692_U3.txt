In my opinion, “On Being Brought from Africa to America” does have a hidden meaning. I think Phillis Wheatly is trying to show a very subtle critic of slavery. To me, the most interesting thing about the poem is who it was written by. The fact that this was written by a female slave who was taught how to read and write at such a young age makes the poem even more impressive. The title was considered to be very controversial by the slave owners of the time. Phillis used the word “brought” when referencing how she actually came to America. It was considered to be controversial because she was essentially kidnapped and forced to come to America, but if she used a more contradictory word other than the word “brought” her poem could have never gotten published or there could have been a possibility of her being killed.

The first line in the poem talks about how mercy from God is what allowed her to survive the harsh journey to America. When she uses the word sable while referring to race, to me it sounds like she is trying to add value because sable was such an expensive thing at the time. Her poem also infers that she does not want people to see slaves as people who are lesser than them just because of their color. She also gives a very controversial Biblical reference to Cain in the last lines of the poem. I think she is trying to give the message that even if someone might be evil they could still be saved.
