How Gender and Race Affect Education Today”

	

	The article “How Gender and Race Affect Education Today” was mainly about how the education system is not doing enough justice for females in today's society. The author Kirah T. also goes in depth on how race and ethnicity affect the way students learn and are treated at all levels of education. For example, The U.S. Department of Education's 2014 Civil Rights Data Collection provides a comprehensive report in which states, “Black students were expelled at three times the rate of white students, and observed that black girls were suspended at higher rates than all other girls and most boys." Kirah T. alludes back to how in today's society it is harder for a female to get accepted into elite colleges rather than men. As stated in the Washington Post, “Colleges won't say it, but this is happening because elite schools field applications from many more qualified women than men and thus are trying to hold the 60:40 women to men ratio." Which is why many people are rooting for gender-blind applications, wanting their applications to be looked at as genderless, just so they’ll have a better chance of being accepted.
