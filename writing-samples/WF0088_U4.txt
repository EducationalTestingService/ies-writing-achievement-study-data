	As a finance major at the University, I took interest in your job posting. I feel certain that my abilities and experience will unite well with the qualifications that you have requested in this position.  I believe that my experience working as an Office Assistant for Universityâ€™s Campus Life as well as holding the position of an Engagement Guild for the Office of Student Leadership and Engagement has given me wonderful preparation for this specific job. 
Working as an Office Assistant for Campus Life I was able to experience working in a fast-paced environment, which is something that was expressed as a valuable skill in your OneMain job posting. I worked with the professional staff filing payroll and updating employment forms for nearly 200 employees under Campus Life. Working at Campus Life I became proficient in Microsoft Excel. At Campus Life I worked under a professional staff that coordinated all of the campus reservations as well as managed the financial information for many student organizations.
As an Engagement Guide for OSLE, I set up events for voter registration and guided many students on how to fill out voter registration forms. My experience as an Engagement Guide gave me a lot of knowledge on how to communicate in groups and lead others toward a common goal. I am interested in this job because I believe that it will give me a great opportunity to learn more about money lending and financial management. I think that working at OneMain would be a rewarding experience, and I believe that I maintain the knowledge and skill set to be a valuable addition to your team. 

Thank you for your consideration,
                             Sam Doe
