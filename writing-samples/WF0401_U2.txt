As of August, 2017 I am a junior in college studying Economics and Finance within business administration. Throughout this course I hope to gain knowledge on how to write proposals and other documents commonly written in the business setting, learn how to address an audience properly in writing, and persuade my peers through my writing. English and writing has never been my strong suit throughout my schooling, but with that being said, I plan to take this course very seriously (along with my other english courses) in order to update and build on my current writing skills. I do know that writing skills are extremely important in the professional business industry, and will more than likely be something I will need to work on for the rest of my life. In economics, there are a lot of reports written on annual income, cash flow, etc.. and different strategies that a business can use increase profits. I am confident in my math skills and how I can use them to benefit me in the economic world, however, I am not confident in how I will manage to transfer my proposed strategies into professional reports. Hopefully, this class will benefit me in that area and I can start practicing writing professional reports for my classes. I would also love to update my current cover letter and resume through this course, as well as updating some of the writing aspects on my LinkedIn account. In BUS 292, my professor mentioned creating a portfolio during the course, so I would enjoy being able to work on more writing aspects of that in this course as well. I understand that a lot of my time will need to be invested into this online class and am prepared to set aside as much time as I would for a regular, 3 credit online course.
