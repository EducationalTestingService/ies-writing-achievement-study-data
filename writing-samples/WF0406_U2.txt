Abstract

A Spirometry study was done by 96 Principles of Biology students at a local university to investigate if any correlation existed between VC and other variables such as, height (cm), chest circumference (cm), and heartbeats per minute(bpm). VC was determined using a spirometer; height using a meter stick; chest circumference using a tape measure; and heartbeats per minute using a stopwatch. A significant correlation existed between VC and height, as well as with chest circumference. There was no correlation between VC and heartbeats per minute. In conclusion, while VC correlated with some variables it did not with others. 























Introduction
Many authors have conversed how vital capacity (VC) in spirometry studies could be influenced by stature, age, gender, health status, and lifestyle. Spirometry can be defined as the process of measuring volumes of air that move into and out of the respiratory system (Seeley et al., 2008). VC can be defined as the sum of the inspiratory reserve volume added to the tidal volume, which is the amount of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a normal expiration (Seeley et al., 2008). The instrument for measuring VC, a spirometer, was invented by John Hutchinson in the early to mid 1800s (Petty, 2002). Hutchinson examined 2,130 individuals and showed that VC is impacted by pulmonary directed (Hutchinson, 1846). VC was found to be increased in individuals who are more physically active, in adult males, and also persons who are tall, thin, and/or athletic (Seeley et al., 2008). Other factors that could affect VC are chest circumference and smoking. For example, in a study by Borken et al. (1981) it was shown that VC is negatively impacted by smoking, where as it increases with increased chest circumference. The applications of spirometry plays an important factor in diagnosing respiratory diseases, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). A study done on DMD used spirometry by finding the maximal VC recorded and the rate of decline which predicted survival time. Spirometry also provided relatively powerful way of determining disease progression in DMD patients (Phillips et al., 2001). Spirometry was used in a study performed by NHANES to find patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Using pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements, NHANES found conclusions such as the effect of air flow from post to pre bronchodilator (Tilert et al., 2013). 

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between VC and other aspects such as height, chest circumference, athleticism, smoking habits, and gender. The objective of this study was to collect spirometry data from college students, which would be pursued for factors affecting VC. The tested hypothesis was that VC correlated with the other factors including stature, heartbeats per minute, age, lifestyle, and gender. 

Materials and Methods
The vital capacity was measured in liters (L) within a group of Principles of Biology students from a local university, laboratory sections L54, L55, L56, and 03C. The total number of students that participated, (n), was 96 students, of whom 71 were females and 25 males. Ranging in age from 17 to 34 years old. Each student measured his/her standing and sitting VC in triplicate. The averages per student were found for both standing and sitting VC trials. 

The other factors studied that could affect VC were the student’s individual measurements of chest circumference (cm), height (cm), and resting pulse rate. The chest circumference was measured with a tape measure and height using a meter stick. After sitting and resting for 10 minutes, the resting pulse rate was measured by placing the index and middle fingers of one hand on the radial artery of the other arm and counting the number of pulses in a 15 second duration. The 15 second duration was timed using a MyChron stopwatch. Resting pulse rate was taken in three replicates, averaged and multiplied by 4 to determine the average number of heart beats per minute. Each student also recorded his/her age, sex, whether a smoker or a non-smoker, and an athlete or a non-athlete. The statistical analysis used to analyze the data for any relationship/correlation between VC and the other parameters recorded was Correlation analysis. 






Results 

Spirometry data for female (n= 71, ages 17 to 24) Principles of Biology students were variable (Table 1). Their average VC (standing) ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, with an overall average of 2.8 L, while their VC (sitting) ranged from 1.8 to 4.2 L averaging 2.8 L (Table 1). Females ranged in height from 150 to 180.5 cm, average 164.9 cm, and their chest circumference (cm) ranged from a low of 67 cm to a high of 127 cm, averaging 87.5 cm (Table 1). The females’ average heartbeats per minute (bmp) ranged from 50.4 to 100 bmp, with an overall average of 76.5 bmp (Table 1.) There were only 2 female smokers. Their average VC was 2.9 L while standing and 2.7 L while sitting. For female nonsmokers (n= 69), the average VC (standing and sitting) ranged from 1.9 to 3.9 L and from 1.8 L to 4.2 L, respectively (Table 1). Their overall VC average were 2.5 L (standing) and 2.8 L (sitting). For female athletes (n= 24), average VC ranged from 2.0 to 3.9 L (standing), and 1.9 to 4.2 L (sitting), respectively. Overall average of the female athlete’s VCs were 2.7 L (standing) and 2.8 L (sitting). For female non-athletes (n= 47), average VC ranged from 1.8 L to 3.8 L (standing), and 1.8 L to 3.7 L (sitting), respectively. Their overall VC averages were 2.9 L (standing) and 2.9 L (sitting) (Table 1).

Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of height (cm) against VC standing (L) for all 96 subjects. Their average VC ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their heights from 150 to 188.4 cm. The scatter plot suggested a positive correlation, that is as standing VC (L) increased height (cm) also increased. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was a significant relationship between standing VC (L) and height (cm) because the calculated value (0.715) exceeded the tabulated value (0.201) at p=0.05 (r= 0.715, n=96, p=0.05). The Null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between height and VC (standing), was therefore rejected.

Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of heart beats per minute and VC standing for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their heartbeats varied from 50.4 to 100 bpm. The scatter plot suggests that there is no correlation, meaning that VC standing is not effected by the bmp. Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis indicated there was no significant relationship between VC standing (L) and heartbeats per minute (bpm) because the calculated value of (0.124) does not exceed the tabulated value (0.201) at p=0.05 (r= 0.124, n=96, p=0.05). The Null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between VC (standing) and heartbeats per minute (bpm), was therefore accepted.

Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of chest circumference against VC (standing) for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their chest circumference ranges from 67 to 127 cm. The scatter plot suggests a positive correlation, that is, as standing VC (L) increased, chest circumference (cm) also increased. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was a significant relationship between VC standing (L) and chest circumference (cm) because the calculated value (0.449) exceeded the tabulated value (0.201) at p=0.05 (r= 0.449, n=96, p=0.05). The Null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between chest circumference and VC (standing), was therefore rejected.

Discussion
An experiment dealing with comparisons of VC with other parameters was performed by Principles of Biology students from a local university. VC showed a significant, positive correlations with height, meaning VC and height had a direct relationship with each other. The hypothesis that VC correlated with other parameters was therefore supported. A plausible reason for positive correlation between height and VC could have been that the taller a person is the larger his/her lungs will be, therefore having higher VC. “This clear relationship between standing height and VC has been taken as scientific fact” since John Hutchinson’s study of VC, standing height, and age. Johnson is starting from Hutchinson’s study that the data between the two factors, VC and standing height, only gave approximate readings not precise ones. The study done on VC and height at the local university could be considered approximate and precise. Hutchinson most likely did not have the right tools to have a precise reading because his study was practiced in 1844. The similarities between the two studies are that there is a direct relationship between height and VC and could almost be considered a scientific fact (Johnston, 2014).

Chest circumference of all the students was then evaluated in relation to VC. The data resulted in a positive correlation, that is, there was a direct relationship between VC and chest circumference. The hypothesis that VC correlation with other parameters was therefore, supported. A plausible reason for this outcome could have been that the larger chest circumference, the more room there will be for inhalation and exhalation, resulting in higher VC. In 1918, the study between VC and chest circumference was being performed by two men, Lundsgaard and Van Slyke (1918), resulting in a definite correlation between chest circumference [volume] and not just VC but, the total capacity, mid capacity and residual air. The differences could root from Lundsgaard and Van Slyke having calculated measurements of the chest in three different places while resting, whereas the local university’s study has chest measurements in one set place while standing (Hurtado and Fray 1933).

The heart beats per minute for each student was calculated and then analyzed with VC. The data resulted in no correlation, meaning VC and heart beats per minute did not have a direct relationship with each other. The hypothesis that VC correlated with other parameters was supported by the comparison. A plausible reason might have been that the lungs are part of the respiratory system and the heart is part of the circulatory system. Therefore, in this particular study they do not affect each other directly. A study was done in 2008 between a sample of males and females, active and not, relating FVC (forced vital capacity) and heartbeats per minute after jumping. There was a correlation between VC and heartbeats per minute in this particular study. This study’s results and the local university’s study results may differ because the difference between forced and not forced VC. Also, the heart beats per minute were calculated for the local university's study standing and sitting, but after jumping for the published work (Fuster et al., 2008). A study on exercising and lung health involves VC and heart rate. Exercising cannot change measurements of total lung capacity, which is the volume of air in the lungs after taking the largest breath possible (TLC), forced VC, and the amount of air able to be blown out after taking the largest breath possible (FVC). The studies relating TLC and FVC had no direct relationship when compared with exercising habits. Exercising and heart rate are related factors, which can be supporting information as to why VC and heart beats per minute had no correlation in the study done at the local university (Barns, 2017).

Lifestyle has a large impact on a person's VC. For example, smoking habits affect VC. In a study by Borken et al. (1981) it was shown that VC is negatively impacted by smoking; Exercise habits with also impacted VC. It has been shown that there is a direct relationship between athletes and high VC. Eating and dieting habits can even be a factor in a person’s VC as well. Living a healthier lifestyle can quite possibly lead to a larger VC (Borken et al., 1981).

It has been established that there is a positive correlation between VC and height as well as VC and chest circumference. It can be said that VC and those factors directly relate to each other. On the other hand, VC and heart beats per minute to not directly relate to each other due the outcome of no correlation. Lifestyle and other factors come into consideration when dealing with VC. VC and heartbeats per minute should be studied and evaluated in more than one experiment. For future studies, chest circumference could be expanded upon and more measurements could be taken to narrow down the data results. Further studies on VC could help with accurate determination of correlations of other parameters with VC.
