Driving Vs. Transportation 



               People have their own opinions on whether driving their own car or a bus is better transportation. There are differences on driving and taking a bus that are discussed. First, driving your own car, you can go where ever you want to go, but bus takes you a certain distance. When driving you can drive hundreds of miles without having to get off. Taking a bus, in contrast, you are free to do other things: since your hands and feet are not occupied. Another major difference between taking a bus and driving is you don’t have to pay for insurance or worry about car repair when taking a bus. When driving you don’t have to wait for any schedule which is beneficial for a driver. Finally, as long as you drive safely, you are safer in your own car than in a bus with strangers. While it is less stressful since you are not in charge, taking the bus is less stressful in a traffic jam. In the end, both have their pros and cons when it comes to transportation.
