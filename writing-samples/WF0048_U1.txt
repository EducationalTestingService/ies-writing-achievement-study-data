Comparison/Contrast Paragraph
In the Purple Hibiscus, two side of Papa, or Eugene, are presented.  His public image differs significantly from his private image.  Outside of his household, Eugene is praised by charities, his community and especially his church because he uses his wealth to support them.  The priest at St. Agnes, Father Benedict, usually refers to Eugene during his sermons.  He mentions how Eugene publishes the truth about the government and does not fear their threats.  Eugene is a man who stands up for the truth. He speaks out for freedom (page 4).  In his home, he is very strict and violent at times. He holds high standards for his wife and kids and expects nothing but perfection from them.  He controls his children’s lives by scheduling their activities from when they wake up to when they fall asleep.  Eugene’s violence is first seen when he flings his missal at Jaja because he was angry at him for not participating in communion (page 7).  Also, Eugene beats on his wife as a punishment for her “sins.”  He beat her so bad that she lost the baby. To his community, Eugene is a gracious, respectable man that stands up for the truth and helps those in need with his wealth.  At home, he is a tyrant. He controls his family’s everyday lives and punishes them when they do not meet his expectations.
