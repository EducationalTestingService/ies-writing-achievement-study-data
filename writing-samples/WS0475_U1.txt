          Crime is a problem in the world, are people crazy losing their minds as the

 world spins around the universe?, or are we brain washed to what is  going on. 

 However In the upcoming years of my 19 years of life I personally haven’t

 witnessed or experienced any illegal acts in my life. However I always

 hear about crimes in the world based on the news. It feels like crime

 in the world is at a all time high in this century but it was actually

 worst in the 80s and 90s. Crime has went down a lot due to a increase

 in national security, decrease in alcohol consumption, and also because 

 a lot of the criminals who committed those crimes back then are still

 imprisoned.

        National security is very important in the country. If there are more police in public places than the less crime there will more likely

 be. For example before 911 there wasn’t a lot of security at the 

airport and after the attack about 2 months later Congress federalized

 airport security by passing the Aviation and Transportation Security

 Act which includes stricter guidelines on passenger and luggage

 screening and only ticketed passengers could go through security.



         Alcohol is not good for you if you can’t control your drinking. 

Alcohol often brings out a different side of you. So the decrease in

 alcohol consumption for this generation is important, it leads to brain

 damage and cause of depression. Each year 4,358 young citizens 

die in alcohol-related deaths as a result of underage drinking 

in car crashes, homicides, alcohol poisoning, falls, burns and suicide

       Not to forget to mention that a lot of the criminals from the 1980s and 1990s are imprisoned still going into the year 2018.

The murder rate from 1980 was at 800,000 arrests and has since

Decreased to 400,000. Another example is the arrest rates, In 

1990 the rate was at 65,000 arrest and have also made a significant 

Decline by 2009 with 41,000 criminal arrest. 

          In conclusion society has improved as a whole recently with its 

Dropping crime rates from the 1980s and 1990s in several different 

Such as Increase in National Security, Decline in alcohol consumption, 

And that those same criminals from the 1980s and 1990s are still 

Behind bars
