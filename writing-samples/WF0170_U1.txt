In the documentary Park Avenue: Money, Power and the American Dream they discuss multiple ways in which money effects our daily lives and the lives of others an example of this would be the Koch brothers and their tight grasp on American politics by their tight grasp on American politics and their overall influence they have  based on their wealth so may argue that despite theses facts the poor may eventually rise to the top of the financial food chain But based on these facts I argue that based on these three things the average wages, the unemployment rate, and finally the political sabotage of the poor that the poor will not be able to rise to the top of financial food chain 
	A factor as in why the poor will never be of equal status as the rich is because of the average wage of a middle-class person versus that of an average wealthy person according to a graph made by the pew research center in 2014 they state that the average income of an household of one for middle class is $24,042 while a single household of one for upper class individuals is $72,126 which is almost 3 times that of an average middle class person in the year 2014 in conclusion this shows how deep and wide the gap is between the rich and poor when it comes to the average wages and income and when it comes to everyday life
