	In my opinion, On Being Brought from Africa to America has a heavy religious tone, specifically Christian. The poem is essentially about the Christian belief that all people can be accepted by God through Salvation of the soul. A line in the poem that supports this idea would be, “Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain, May be refined, and join the angelic train.” The “angelic train,” in this case, being Heaven as perceived by Christians.

	Another thing that should be noted is that by using context clues, the idea that Wheatley was from an area in Africa that had never been exposed to the Christian belief and that he was only exposed to Christianity by being brought to America, a heavily Christian influenced area, can be made. The first two lines, “Twas mercy brought me from my pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand,” exemplify this idea. The term “benighted” means to have an ignorance of a moral or belief. 

	Lastly, there is a presence of racial undertones within the poem. The poem was written in 1773. This poem, then, was written as African Americans were primarily used for slave work. The African American population of the time was not seen as equal to the general American population. The poem states this idea with the line, “Some view our sable race with a scornful eye, “Their color is a diabolic dye.”” “Color” is referred to as diabolic, meaning that it is evil. This is a thought that could be related back to the general opinion of the American population.
