Yes, Faith Is an absence of thought. In order to have faith you must trust in the things you cannot see. Life is about more than just thinking. You can feel the things that you aren’t able to see. For example you cannot see the wind but you can feel it and see the effects of it. Similarly you cannot see or even think of what God looks like, but you can feel him and see the effects he has on people. You can tell when someone has faith in God and when they feel his presence because you can clearly see they live a different life. It is something that is difficult to explain because it is something you feel not something you think about.



Scenario 2

	Yes, Faith is an absence of thought. If you look at all of the recent discoveries and realize where they came from this becomes obvious. Electricity was discovered because someone thought about what lightning actually is. It was not discovered by having faith and blindly following some “God”. Benjamin Franklin thought long and hard about what lightning is and how to harness it. He used his skill set and his thoughts in order to do it.
