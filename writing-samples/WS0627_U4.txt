I personally liked Edward Taylorâ€™s writings. Edward Taylor was my favorite author because of the way he handled his congregation. He was able to empathize with his people and understand how they were feeling. He was able to understand the problems they were having in trusting God. His empathy towards others and his understanding of real-world problems were what made Edward Taylor my favorite author.
