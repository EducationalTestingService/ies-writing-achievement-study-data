It is NOT demanding 



Love is not demanding. An illustration of how love is not demanding is love does not ask you to change your personality or life to fit their needs. It wouldn’t ask you to stop talking to certain people or how you should act. Another example is love does not make you deposit your hard-earned paycheck into their account. After being trapped at work all week to provide for yourself and others, love should not demand that you give them any of your money to get their desires. Also, love does not demand you to constantly feed them attention. It doesn’t need to call you every hour or talk to you every minute of the day. Love is much more than this, but is definitely not demanding.
