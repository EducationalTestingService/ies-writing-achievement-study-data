On Being Brought From Africa to America Essay



In my opinion, On Being Brought From Africa to America definintly has some underlying meaning. In this time period, an African American knowing how to write and do so proficiently was unheard of. Phillis Wheatley used her talent and ability to her benefit, speaking out against the slave trade without plainly stating so and protecting herself while sharing her experience. When reading the poem in my mind, I picture the tone to be sort of dark. The experience she is describing is not one filled with joy, and the word choice hints towards darkness too. Words such as, "scornful, diabolic," and even her biblical reference towards the story of Cain all hint towards a dark message she is trying to share. By using religion in her poem, she appeals to not just the Africans under prosecution, but most of the white population during this time period too. A belief in God was expected to be in everyone during this era, and she uses it to her advantage when conveying her story in this poem. Her last stanza mentions hope, a hope for the Africans who feel lost, and for the Christians as well, again she uses the story of Cain and Able, Cain murdering his beloved brother, yet still able to be saved. This gives the idea that she believes if she can be saved and brought to the light of God, other people can too, even the people who represent evil instead of good.
