Contrast Paragraph
     At University, My English 101 and Math 125 classes have many differences in regards to the professor, the content, and the way I feel towards the class. The first main contrast between my classes is the professor. In my English class, I have a female professor, whereas my professor is a male for my math class. The content of each class are completely opposite to each other as well. In English I’ve been learning how to better my writing through reading, writing a variety of essays, and examining other pieces of writing. Math consists of trying to solve different types of math problems using a variety of equations and critical thinking. A majority of the time I’m looking at words in English, and numbers in math. Finally, I look at the two classes in different lights. Overall, I can say that I prefer English class over math class, mainly because I’ve never truly enjoyed solving equations and dealing with numbers, especially to the extent of college level math. English is not my favorite subject, but I can tolerate the class more simply because I do enjoy writing and the class is easier to understand. My English and math courses have many variety of ideas within themselves that make them so different from each other.
