High School vs College



	Although college experiences are different then high school experiences, there is a lot of things that are similar. For instance, the work load is the same, you are expected to get assignments done by the short term due date. You also must try maintaining a social life while completing that work. You will notice that there are people who will make it to graduation and others who will not due to stress and other reasons. College and high school experiences are also very different. In contrast, college experiences are more stressful because you are all on your own. You also must deal with the stressful process of paying for college, most students spend majority of their time in the financial aid office trying to figure out how they will continue attending school. They are stressed about finding their classes on such a huge campus and making new friends. High school is different than college because when you are in school you do not have to worry about being out of your comfort zone. For example, when entering high school, you will typically be going to school with the same people you went to school with since elementary school. Also, teachers are more hands on when teaching their students, they remind them when things are due and give out lots of worksheets. Both college ang high school experiences are so similar, but so different.
