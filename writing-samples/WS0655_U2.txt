The Social Media Monster

	In just one swift click of a button, someone has gained a new friend. Social Networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have taken over today’s society. They each started out as a way for people to connect with friends and family but quickly turned into a fame-seeking monster. Social Media today serves as a substitute for a real social life. 

	Many people have become obsessed with how many followers or Facebook friends they can accumulate. We tend to see these followers as “friends”, but we do not know them at all. Yes, in fact, we are being social by communicating with the people we meet online, but does that mean we obtain a social life? I have observed over the years that some people do consider this as having a social life. I am also guilty of having these thoughts even though I know that it is not correct. As people, we enjoy having the comfort of others viewing our social sites, because it lets us know that we are not alone in our thoughts and ideas. 

	Someone who has gained almost millions of followers on Instagram is thought to have a perfect social life. However, those people are the ones whom, in real life, have the dullest social lives. They are so consumed by what is happening inside the screen of their phone or computer to realize how much they lack. Having a social life should require you to physically go out and interact with people. Social media has turned into a way for a person to hide who they really are. The way someone carries themselves on social media could be far different from how they carry themselves in person. 

	Today, we need to strive to have more human interactions rather than friends we only see when we open our various applications. We can discover so much more about ourselves by doing so and develop memories that will last a lifetime. Social media needs to be returned to a way for us to share things with family or friends that we may not get to see often.
