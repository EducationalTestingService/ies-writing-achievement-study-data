Love is anything but abuse in a relationship. In “How to Identify Love by Knowing What’s Not” speaks about how love is encouraging, speaking kind words, and using one’s hands lovingly. Also, how love is not hitting, controlling, and name calling. It is very important to know when you are in a loving or abusive relationship. For instance, you may not even know you are in an abusive relationship, it may seem normal because all couples go through “rough patches”. But when your partner lay their hands on you to cause pain, or to lower your self-esteem to have power over you, that is not love. 

Also, love is not controlling, for example when a partner keeps you from seeing friends and family or will not let you go to work. Using jealousy to take control over your life physically, emotionally, or verbally. Lastly, love is not name calling or any form of tearing down one’s self-esteem, for example a partner blaming you for anything going wrong in their life and taking it out on you. Another example is name calling such as fat, stupid, and worthless, real love is nothing like this. The Truth is that love is the opposite, instead of tearing down, love encourages. Love speaks kind words to one another, not words of insult to have power over someone else.  

Real love does not lay hands on someone out of anger to cause harm, but in true love hands are used to show affection towards someone else. In conclusion, love is anything but abuse, love does not give fear, harm, or pain but takes it away.
