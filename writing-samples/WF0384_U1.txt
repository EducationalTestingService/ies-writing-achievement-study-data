All About Me Essay


My name is Sam Doe. My parents picked my first name because they liked the “regal sound” of it when it was compared to my sister’s name being Casey and my brother’s name being Riley. My dad chose to spell my name with a “C” versus a “K” because he felt that spelling Sam with a “K” is “too American” and liked the alternative spelling better. My middle name “Sam” is my dad’s mother’s name and he wanted to honor her in some way when I was born. I am the youngest of three siblings; my sister is an English teacher in Anytown, USA and my brother is a Mass Communication major at my college. My parents are still married and I am very fortunate to have that, my mother is a nurse practioner and my father works for a fork lift company managing their sales.
Dance has been a huge part of my life, I have been dancing for 15 years. My local dance studio is the Anytown School of Ballet in Anytown, USA. I am trained in classical ballet, modern, lyrical, hip hop, and pointe. When I was a sophomore in high school I was in modern class when I tore a ligament in my ankle. I was told that I would have to take six to eight months off from dance to let my ankle heal, but I ended up taking two weeks off and then going back to classes. To this day my ankle is not fully healed and can be very painful when I dance or walk long distances.
My major is Secondary Education Biology with a minor in dance. I’ve known since I was eight years old that I wanted to be a teacher but I never knew what age group or what subject. I changed my mind from elementary education to middle school English and then middle school English. It wasn’t until my sophomore year of high school when I was randomly placed into advanced anatomy that I discovered I wanted to teach high school Biology.
