“How to Identify Love by Knowing What It’s Not” by Augusten Burroughs tackles everything one should know about love in order for the reader to understand the red flags associated with false love. False love is when a person in a relationship treats the significant other in a cruel manner even though the abused may likely mistake that for “caring.” Burrough starts off the reading by listing everything love isn’t from, “Love doesn’t use a fist. Love never calls you fat or lazy or ugly. Love doesn’t laugh at you in front of your friends…” etc. In relationships, it isn’t uncommon when a significant other abuses their mate in a physical, emotional and sexual manner. Physical abuse deals with violence while emotional abuse deals with shattering the confidence and self-esteem by verbally hurting the abused. Sexual abuse involves a partner making unwanted sexual advances to his/her partner. These kinds of abuse can be done by male and female. It is important for anyone in a relationship to be mindful to the fact that any abuse can be subtle and one can go through it without even knowing. These people may see the abuser just as a little controlling. However, if one is aware of what is considered physical, sexual and emotional abuse, one can be protected by getting the help he/she needs if he/she feels abused in any way.
