Scenario 1

	Is faith an absence of thought? Absolutely not. In my opinion, thought is an absence of faith. The amount of people that have strayed away from God during this era is deeply disturbing. Even though faith is not an absence of thought, religion is not something that you should have to think about anyways. Religion is supposed to be something you feel. People need to open up to God and accept his almighty grace to truly understand what being a Puritan is about. There is no words that can describe how one feels when the power of God has consumed them or someone around them. Worldly materialism is threatening our religion and way of life. If someone wants to use their own brain to think, then think about the souls that will be damned if a change in the current trend is not embraced. 



Scenario 2

	Is faith an absence of thought? Most likely. In my experience, I have used my intuition and found a great deal of success. This also holds true for a majority of people that I associate with. We have minds of our own and have been using them with great success without divine intervention. Many scientific advancements have taken place recently without the word of God to guide us. These scientific discoveries conflict with the traditionally held Puritan beliefs.  Once we started thinking, we started to have advancements. Faith has hindered our ability to progress as a species. We should continue to use our minds to progress for a more prosperous future.
