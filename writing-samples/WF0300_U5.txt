Status Report
Project Status Summary
I am currently on schedule with the work I want to have completed, and should remain on time with my remaining work. 
Work Completed
I have completed my literature review and plan on moving forward with the paper. I have almost all of my data collected through interviews and surveys on my test group. 
Work Planned for Next Two Weeks
Week 9: I have completed 6 out of 8 interviews and surveys planned. I will finish the last two in this week and will transcribe my findings to paper to report on.
Week 10: I plan on beginning the writing of the final assignment in this week, whether that be my method or results etc. I will complete at least one or two of these parts of the final paper each week from here on out. 
Open Issues and Risks
The risks I may have are having a small data sample, but i will compare my findings to other studies in my literature review and should have sufficient content. I am having trouble understanding which pieces of the paper to begin currently but I am sure you will resolve those in class and through our readings in our class books.
Milestones
Module 3, and any other assignments will be turned in on time, or at least I plan on continuing to my work as I have done. By November 1, I plan on reporting on my data. By the middle of November I plan on being halfway done with my paper, and by December 3 I plan on reviewing my work and making corrections to it for my final draft.
KSIâ€™s
I am on schedule according to the pace I have set for myself and plan on keeping to that pace. I plan on writing a page to two pages per week after November 1, depending on what content I am reporting on during that week.
