Topic Interests:
I have chosen to write about topic one. I decided to write about this topic because patient consent is very important in the medical practice. Henrietta Lacks cells were the first cells to ever be cloned. Lacks cells helped developed the polio vaccine. Although it led to an incredible medical breakthrough in a range of medical areas, it was unethical to use Lacks medical records without the appropriate consent. Henrietta's family was unaware of this. I was very interested in this topic because I want to be a pediatric nurse one day. I think it is important to argue the severity of keeping patient's medical records confidential.  



Research Procedures:

I think that I need to research about the repeated use of African American patients in medical research without their consent. I need to find more cases in which this informed consent was not effective. This will help expound the argument of how such use is inappropriate despite the benefits. I can get my factual evidence from journals, the book and other books. 



Purpose and claim:

The purpose of my research is to persua using patients and medical subjects with informed consent is inappropriate. I need to argue why it is inappropriate despite the fact the benefits it has brought about. My preliminary thesis statement is " Despite the benefits it has brought about, use of patients and medical subjects without the appropriate consent is unethical, distrusting, and unlawful. "
