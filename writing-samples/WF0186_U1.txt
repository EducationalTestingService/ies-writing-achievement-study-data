Dear Ms. Blount,

As a current student at the University with a major in Marking Strategy, I learned about a potential marketing internship (ID: #56191) within your organization through the University Career Centerâ€™s SeaWork system. I believe that my previous experiences through an internship and my leadership positions in student organizations would be beneficial to Animal Rescue Effort.  

Currently I hold two positions within campus organizations that have helped me develop my professional communication skills. In the Association for Campus Entertainment (ACE) I often assist in the creation of marketing strategies for various events. As Co-Sponsorship Coordinator, I form connections to other student organizations to co-sponsor ACE events, creating mutualistic relationships between organizations. These connections benefit both parties as it improves marketing effectiveness and frequently involves the usage of social media to spread awareness. These lessons as a Co-Sponsorship Coordinator would be directly applicable to helping form marketing strategies for Animal Rescue Effort.

Please refer to my attached resume. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss further how my previous experiences would be beneficial to Animal Rescue Effort. If you need to get in contact with me, I may be reached by phone at (555)-555-5555 or by email at samdoe@uni.edu.

Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely, Sam Doe
