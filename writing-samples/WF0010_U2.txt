Materials and Methods
	In a university, a total of 96 students partook in an experiment to test their individual vital capacity during a Principles of Biology lab session. Four sections participated and consisted of ages ranging from seventeen to thirty-four years of age as well as seventy-one female students and twenty-five male students. The experiment was carried out using a Phipps and Bird 9-Liter Wet Spirometer and the students measured in the unit of liters during their recordings. During the experiment, vital capacity was observed in two positions, the standing position and the sitting or supine position, and was tested three times in each position. Each participant calculated averages for their vital capacity based on their sitting and standing readings to come up with two averages which were recorded for the overall data. 
	Factors that did not involve the positions vital capacity was measured in were also recorded during the duration of the activity. Chest circumference was measured to give an indication as to how much room the lungs had to expand, height was measured to determine how high or low the capacity normally is, and the resting heart rate was recorded and averaged. The chest circumference and height of each student was measured with standard tape measures and meter sticks respectively. After resting for 10 minutes the students used a MyChron stopwatch to time fifteen seconds while placing the index and middle fingers on the radial artery of the opposing arm and counting the number of beats for the fifteen second duration. There were three repeats of the resting heart rate, which was then averaged and multiplied by four times to get the resting pulse rate of each student.
