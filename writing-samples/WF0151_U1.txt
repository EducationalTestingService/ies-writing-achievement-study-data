Subject: StrengthsFinder & CareerLeader Assessments

After taking the time to evaluate myself and analyze my results from the StrengthsFinder and CareerLeader tests, I can conclude that these assessments are valid. Each reporting from both tests provided data that is useful in helping one understand what their strengths are and what one must do to apply them. 
Test Results
With the StrengthsFinder test, the results included five signature themes that are representative of my character. These top five themes were selected among thirty-four others. My top five themes included: Strategic, Includer, Positivity, Empathy, and Futuristic.
With the CareerLeader test, I discovered what interests, motivators, and skills that personally matched me the best. I have a significantly higher interest in Creative Production than any other potential interest. I am strongly motivated by security, altruism, affiliation, and lifestyle in a work environment. Some of my key skills include: creative thinking, ability to compromise, respect of trust, and empathy skills.
Correlations Between StrengthFinder and Career Match
When comparing both results of the tests, there is a strong correlation between the two. On both of the tests, one of my strongest skills was being empathic. I am able to see things from other people’s point of views, and able to defuse situations at ease. 
Another similarity between results is my motivation to be altruistic from CareerLeader. This can be tied into three of my themes from StrengthsFinder – Positivity, Empathy, and Futuristic. These three themes are relevant to one another because to be altruistic one must want the satisfaction of contributing for the betterment of the world. This done through the spread of positivity, being empathetic, and having a futuristic outlook on world. 
Findings from Data
While the StrengthsFinder and CareerLeader assessments do not test for the exact same criteria, their results are still can be compared to one another to make conclusions about one’s character. For example, StrengthsFinder seems to test specifically for finding your core strengths, while CareerLeader assess for other useful information – such as what motivates your or potential career fields.
Using myself as an example, I tested as an individual with strong interpersonal effectiveness and strategic decisions making skills on both assessments. There were not any major discrepancies between either result.
Overall, I believe that this reveals that these assessments can be effective in representing one accurately. Of course, there will always be the chance for error – as in the results are not representative of oneself accurately or that it is too subjective – but that can be said for any other test. 
Conclusions
After analyzing both assessments, I can conclude that both StrengthsFinder and CareerLeader are effective tools in making academic and career related decisions. I learned what my core strengths are through StrengthsFinder, and learned what I can do to utilized these to their full potential. Through CareerLeader I learned what motivates me, what my key skills are, what career path would match me the best. Utilizing both as tools, I am able to put myself on the right track for my future to be successful.
