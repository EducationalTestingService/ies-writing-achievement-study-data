	Throughout this semester my favorite author we covered was Thomas Paine. I am a bit of a history nut and so the importance of him form a historical context always made him a standpoint. It was cool to see how his works progressed literature and writing styles of the times, knowing the historical impact that it had. The harsh language and tough love nature to his writing really fit the nature and urgency that I am sure that he was in. I truly imagine that it was a situation of him telling them (the colonist) what they needed to hear and not necessarily what they wanted to hear. Thomas Paine is one of my favorite colonial times historical figures, so learning about him from a different perspective was really cool.
