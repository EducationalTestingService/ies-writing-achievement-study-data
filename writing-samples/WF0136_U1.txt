The typical Christian message has one thing that really digs under the fingernails and into the exposed flesh below, and that is a cop-out for when things aren't going the way they should in a just world: trusting that an almighty god has a plan that explains all of the pain and suffering away. In "The Wanderer," it is evident that there is an almighty god and thus a Christian message present from the fifth line, "Fate is firmly set." With the Christian god being omniscient, the fact that fate is set is indisputable. Christians not only trust that their almighty god is justified in distributing punishment to themselves but to the entire world as well. In the Christian's holy book, their god even causes a flood on such a large scale that almost all of humanity is exterminated. "'Mankind's Creator laid waste this middle-earth till the clamor of city-dwellers ceased to be heard and ancient works of giants stood empty, line 85-87," in the "Wanderer." Floods lay waste to all life that happens to be in their way, leaving only silence and emptiness behind.However striking the similarities so far, the icing to top the cake lies in lines 114-115 when "The Wanderer" says, "All shall be well for him who seeks grace, help form out Father in heaven where a fortress stands for us all." After over 100 lines of recounting an agonizing life of loneliness and despair, all is well if one only trusts in god.
