                          In the book, “Purple Hibiscus” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche, she writes about a young girl, Kambili Achike, that is going through situations that develops her into maturity to deal with her family constant battle of religion and morals.  
                        The book can be relatable in the sense of children dealing with strict, religious parents. Instead of relating to the main character Kambili, most people can draw a connection to her brother Jaja. Jaja is going through his rebellious teenage phase, which everyone goes through, where we start to question our parent’s morals that they had engraved in us. 
                     By the first chapter it is shown how when at church, Jaja did not eat the communion that was given to him, which his father felt was disrespectful. The reason Jaja had to not eat the communion was unethical reason to his father. Jaja argued that the communion was gross, and he did not enjoy it, Kambili was shocked that Jaja would even talk back to their father but was confused of why nobody openly spoked about how his father threw something at Jaja out of anger too. I related more to Jaja because he chose to rebel against what his father said. He wanted to question the customs of his father and his devotion to his religion. Unlike Kambili that respects what her father says and because she is too afraid to challenge what he says.
