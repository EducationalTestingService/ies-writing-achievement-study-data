A young woman named Kaylee Muthart who lives in Anderson, SC suffers from a terrible tragedy. After having smoked laced marijuana and the failed relationship with her boyfriend of two years Muthart experienced a mental breakdown and was soon diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This led to her abuse of drugs such as ecstasy and Xanax. In the article it says “she believed the drugs were bringing her closer to God.” One day Muthart injected a large dose of meth which she had never used before causing her to hallucinate. This hallucination and the encounter with a mysterious stranger then persuaded her to sacrifice herself by using her fingers to pull each of her eyes out the socket. “While on ecstasy, I studied the Bible”, Muthart said. “I misinterpreted a lot of it. I convinced myself that meth would bring me even closer to God.” A nearby witness was able to come to her aid but there was no way to recover her sight. The traumatic experience was enough for her to realize she needed to get help; she entered a rehabilitation center where she could start a new lifestyle. Everything that Muthart has went through has helped her get back on the right path and she could not be any happier.
