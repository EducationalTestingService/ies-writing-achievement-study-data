Diagnostic Essay #1
	A good outcome may come from people of other ethnic groups altering public space. Public space may be positively altered by avoiding any activities that seem even remotely threatening. Staples had “moved about with care… give a wide berth to nervous people on the subway platforms.” Instead of being straightforward and normal on his walk on the subway, he chose to be more careful and watched his spacing. His actions took into account how others feel and most likely eased any nervous emotions or uncomfortability. If he had not done so, considering his ethnicity in mind and the common stereotype that goes along with it, the public would’ve reacted to him as if he were a threat. Also to alter space he “whistled melodies from Beethoven and Vivaldi” and let skittish people “clear the lobby before returning, as to not seem to be following them.” These actions aim to cause a lighter atmosphere or calmer mood in the public. It is good to seek this sort of outcome because in contemporary society the public is sensitive to race and keen on stereotypes. In the case of Staples, he actively tries to oppose the common stereotype that black men are thugs, or a threat. A thug would be listening to rap, have a certain walk, and overall give off a dangerous or threatening atmosphere. But Staples acts exactly the opposite in public. Those other ethnic groups have the power to positively alter public space by acting like Staples in public. Specifically, they would either have to take extra care in their daily actions or aim to completely oppose their stereotype. Disregard to their actions in public space could lead to misunderstandings or worse conflict, and that is why extra care is focused on actions in public space. Some actions can be taken negatively instead of positively.
