Subject: Career Leader and StrengthsFinder Reports																			              I found that within my StrengthsFinder report and CareerLeader results they correlated in many different ways. I will answer two questions within this memo that will address my results and also compare the two. The two questions are how your StrengthsFinder top five themes align with your CareerLeader assessment and what is your overall impression of these two assessments? 	How do you view the results as helpful to you in making academic and career decisions? 																								        The results from my StrengthsFinder were achiever, individualization, responsibility, context, and strategic. The higher interests that I found as a result of taking the CareerFinder were influencing others, enterprise control, and quantitative analysis. The motivators that I received were altruism, positioning, and security. The top skills I got were interpersonal effectiveness, power and influence, analysis and strategic decision making, and bringing management structure. Most of my career matches were management positons and some banking along with sales. 	     								  																 I see many different similarities within the two tests and the reports that came from them. Responsibility and strategic go along with the careers in management. Management positions requires you to have strong qualities in responsibility so that you can hold what comes along with managing. While being strategic requires you to possess the qualities that allow you to strategically make smart decisions. I saw that many of my themes aligned and the definitions would overlap with each together. I noticed that a lot of my qualities fed into the positions that were picked for me and almost were the exact description for the job. I saw many similarities in the definitions and some repetition in what both of the reports concluded. 												                                                            Overall I felt like the two assignments were very correct when it comes to matching my traits and how they play into my job selections. I could see how the results truly did fit my personality and how I am now in my job that I have currently. I liked how much more I learned about myself and the traits that I possess. I feel like it will 	benefit me now that I know more about myself and will make it easier for me to use them. I can see how the results will help me when choosing what career, I want to pursue. The career fields I am thinking about going in to were on my list which makes me feel more confident about my choices. I can tell that I will out what I have learned about myself to use in my academic and career decisions.	                                                     
                                                                        						                             I can honestly say that the StrengthFinder and CareerLeader assessments are some very realistic and honest tests. The answers defined my traits and personality very well to the point where I would recommend anyone to take these assessments in order to help them better define themselves. I think the tests are great for students and will most definitely help with career choices.
