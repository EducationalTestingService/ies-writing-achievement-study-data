	Throughout this course, I have had the opportunity to read examples from authors that I had not read from before. By reading from these authors, I was exposed to some of the first thoughts and writings of our nation, which is a privilege in itself. My favorite author that I studied about this semester was John Smith. My favorite work that I read was A Genral History of Virginia. I chose this as my favorite work because when I was reading the excerpt, I was able to visualize a part of early American history that most people cannot. I could visualize the hardships early settlers faced, including death and illness. I could also visualize the relationships between early settlers and the Native American population of the early stages of America. Through reading all of the provided excerpts in this course, I have come to have both a greater appreciation of early American literature and a stronger understanding of American history.
