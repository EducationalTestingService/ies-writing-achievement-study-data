Paragraph
	In the narrative story, “Purple Hibiscus”, conflicts arise in the Achike household located in Enugu, Nigeria. In the opening chapters of the novel, it is Palm Sunday and Jaja has missed communion. After church, Jaja and Papa get into a disagreement about why he did not take communion. After discussing that “the wafer gives me bad breath”, Papa reveals his anger by “[picking] up the missal and [throwing] it across the room” (Adichie 6-7). The missal does not make it to hit Jaja but, instead it hits the étagère. These actions show Papa’s role in the household. Since he is the provider, he wants to be respected and obeyed. Instead, Jaja does what he wants to do which is not pleasing to his father. Thus causing conflict within their household, due to the problem between Jaja and Papa.
