Positivity Outshines Struggles
In the excerpt "Letter to My Daughter", by Maya Angelou informs readers about the major events of the life of the author from what Angelou could remember from childhood by moving place to place in different states and cities with different family members. Also, mentioning the teenage years of when Maya Angelou met a boy but shared no connection with. As well as, transitioning through teenage life into motherhood. Maya Angelou is a celebrated poet, novelist, educator, dramatist, producer, actress, historian, and civil rights activist (ASHA 19).  Growing up Angelou was abused by her mother's boyfriend who was then killed by her uncles and it caused her to go mute for 6 years (ASHA 19). As well as, giving birth to a baby boy at 16 and becoming a dancer in her early 20s (ASHA 19). In her book, she uses rhetorical strategies to present parts of her life story and connect with her readers. Although her life was a struggle, she used those outcomes and turned it into a positive for others to learn and grow from her experiences rhetorically. 
Something that stood out the most in Angelou's excerpt is a common use of imagery throughout her writing. Maya Angelou illustrates her take on philanthropy and in that paragraph she mentions, the meaning of philanthropy and shares an experience between her and her mother.  In the passage from her book, she states, "She put her hand on my cheek and smiled. "Come on baby, smile for mother. Come on...She made a funny face and against my wishes, I smiled. She kissed me on the lips and started to cry" (Angelou 23-24). The author uses imagery to have readers picture this moment in their heads to be one with the writer. The purpose of imagery is to have reader feel like they're in the author's story while reading it. With every sentence, she offers a scenario by describing every action her mother does and every action Maya Angelou does as well. From this readers can get a better understanding of what the author was experiencing at the time. Another example of imagery the author mentions,"When the baby started coming, my little mother jumped off the table and seeing him emerge, she shouted, "Here he comes and he has black hair." I wondered what color she thought he might have" (Angelou 64). With this moment shared from Maya Angelou, it gives readers an idea of how everything went down in the delivery room. She wants readers to feel as if they were there with her mother jumping off the table and shouting as the baby was coming. The reason behind imagery is to have the audience experience the story using their imagination to get a more clear and better-developed understanding of the author's story. 
Pathos refers to the audience's feelings and relies for persuasive effect on triggering audience emotions such as happiness, sadness, satisfaction, pity, or fear (Higgins). In Maya Angelou's book there were a lot of different emotions presented all throughout her story. She shares a variety of different situations to showcase all the different emotions she felt throughout her life. A particular event she shares is when her mother calls her beautiful for smiling and she reveals, "That day, I learned that I could be a giver by simply bringing a smile to another person. The ensuing years have taught me that a kind word, a vote of support is a charitable gift. I can move over and make another place for someone" (Angelou 27). From reading this quote from Maya Angelou's book you can sense the positivity and happiness that she is feeling. When reading this readers can feel her emotion of happiness through her text and how her mother helped her bring happiness to others. Not only does she make the audience feel her own emotions, but she also makes the reader feel as if they are the person she is spreading her positivity and kindness too. Writing with emotion provides readers with a whole new experience of reading and it could even impact someone's life. Another example from her book states, "My real growing up world, in Stamps, was a continual struggle against a condition of surrender. Surrender first to the grown up human beings who I saw every day, all black and all very, very large" (Angelou 4). Angelou shows an emotion of resistance to be able to at least try to stand up for herself against these "grown human beings" (Angelou 4) where she felt like she was put into a situation where she felt like she needed to give into them. Not only does Maya Angelou help readers understand her point of view on how she felt, but she also makes her audience feel sympathy for her because she had to go through that. The use of pathos is to be able to have your audience connect with your emotions and be able to be in the moment of your story to get a better understanding of the author's argument.  
In her book, she also uses an assortment of figurative language. The purpose of figurative language is to give a better understanding by giving readers an image or by comparing things to one another. One of the figurative languages Maya Angelou uses is simile. As she talks about her point of view of what growing up really means she mentions, "the children inside, are still innocent and shy as magnolias" (Angelou 10). What she means by this is that the inner child inside of you no matter how much you are growing old you are still very "innocent" and "shy" comparing it to a magnolia. She uses simile because she wants her audience to be able to understand what she is trying to say in a different style of writing. She also says, "Those voices need to be encouraged to sing again and again, with even more emotion" (Angelou 12). In this sentence, she uses personification giving the voice life as if it was a human and needed encouragement. She is talking about how people should be encouraged to be able to speak up for what they stand for and believe in, but be passionate. The reason for personification is to help an author's writing become more effective and help readers really think about what the author is trying to say. She uses personification to convey her message by providing a message behind it and saying what she has to say in her own way that is unique, but still understandable. A different kind of figurative language she uses is anaphora, where she states, "If I stop, she stops. If I go, she goes" (Angelou 19). With this quote, she is saying exactly what the text says, but the way it is formatted gives it more of an emphasis on the topic. She wants reader to really know that she truly did follow her grandmother everywhere she went. Maya Angelou uses anaphora to dramatize this situation so readers can get an idea of how much she really loved being around her grandmother. 
Maya Angelou often expressed her feelings in her book and what she was doing. She gave readers her point of view to be able to see her side of the story as well as others included in her story. She included her opinions, what she heard, felt, and said. She talks about her point of view when she had to tell her parents she was pregnant and she gives this example, "The sound of him walking away was not nearly as loud as the sound of my heart racing. Downstairs at the table he said, "I'm going to call your mother. How far along are you?" (Angelou 51). Maya Angelou gave us her feeling of her nervousness when she was racing down the stairs. She was afraid of the outcome of what her dad was going to say or do.  However, we do not know what her dad's thoughts are or his point of view on the whole situation, but from her side, she feels anxious. From giving her point of view to her audience, the audience can put themselves in her situation and feel what she's feeling or what she is seeing. From a different perspective she shares a point of view from her father after she gave birth to her baby boy she says, "My dad said when she returned home, she was so tired, she looked as if she had given birth to quintuplets" (Angelou 68). After the birth of her son her father gives her an exaggerated perspective on her mother. The reason for point of view is to be able to envision what other people are seeing. From the example from the excerpt,  her father's point of view on her mother really helped readers understand and see how much effort Maya Angelou's mother put into her birth. Another point of view she gives is, "I am convinced that most people do not grow up. We find parking spaces and honor our credit cards. We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old" (Angelou 10). She gives us her own thought based on the idea of growing up. From her point of view of going against what people would usually say and say we are growing up she mentions that she believes we are growing old. Which shows that her perspective is different from what everyone else may have most likely said. She gives readers a perspective of going against what society thinks and shows readers that she is different from everyone else. She helps readers see her personality through her writing and helps others see what kind of things she sees differently from others. She shows readers that it is ok to not always agree with others and thinking what you believe. Lastly, she shares her own opinion on how she feels about the title "You Can't Go Home Again". She mentions "I enjoyed the book but I never agreed with the title. I believe that one can never leave home. I believe that one carries the shadows, the dreams, the fears and dragons of home under one's skin, at the extreme corners of ones eyes and possibly in the gristle of the earlobe" (Angelou 7). Maya Angelou informs reader on how she saw the title through her own beliefs. When stating your own point of view you can give readers an identity for yourself. When expressing your side of what you feel it could make a connection to readers to relate to what you have to say. 
Rhetorical devices can give a whole new meaning to a story if used correctly. Maya Angelou uses a variety of rhetorical strategies to be able to connect with her audience and share her life experiences. There are many parts to her story where readers can connect with her as a person and picture her life through their eyes. Different techniques used throughout her book could help readers understand in their own different ways from what they take from her writing. Not only does Maya Angelou help her audience understand the use of rhetorical strategies, but she entertains them while teaching the use of rhetoric through her story. This promotes readers envision what she sees and gives them the emotions that she was feeling at the time. She also gives readers a clearer idea of what she is trying to say. As well as, sharing her own perspective on dealing with situations or experiencing different situations throughout her life and through other's lives. Even though she had a bad experience at life in the beginning, she made what she had into a positive. Sharing the growth and the obstacles she overcame as a young adult and as a child. Even though all the experiences she went through it made her into the person she was and she just shows that any situation can be turned into a positive situation if you have a different outlook on things just as she did.
