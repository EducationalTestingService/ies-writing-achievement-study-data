Illustrative Paragraph







	You know when a person loves you by their actions. Someone who loves you won’t allow you to doubt the relationship. When in love you won’t be able to go long without the significant other. If your in love, small arguments will not be able to break your bond.  A true love will accept you and all of your faults. If you ever fall, love will be there to catch you and help you get back up.
