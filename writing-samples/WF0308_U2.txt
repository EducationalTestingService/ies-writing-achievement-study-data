Introduction

Spirometry studies in the past have found how vital capacity (VC) may be impacted by stature, age, gender, health status and life status. VC being the most amount of air that a person can exhale after a maximum inspiration (Seeley et al., 2008). An instrument called a spirometer was first invented by John Hutchinson in the 1800s (Petty, 2002), and was used to measure the capacity to live which is now known as VC. VC was found to increase/decrease based on someone’s sex, age, body size, and physical activity (Seeley et al., 2008). An example of this being that trained athletes sometimes have a VC 30%-40% above those that are not trained (Seeley et al., 2008). Other factors that could impact VC could be if someone smokes, and more specifically than that stated above, height and chest circumference. Knowing ones’ VC can help identify patients that are at risk of many different diseases. Some of these diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, heart attack, stroke, and all-cause morality (Petty, 2002). 

The purpose of this study was to investigate if there was a relationship between VC and other parameters such as sex, smoker/non-smoker, age, athlete/non-athlete, height, chest circumference, and resting pulse rate. The overall objective of this study was to collect spirometry data from college students which would be analyzed for factors affecting VC. The hypothesis tested is that the VC correlated with the other parameters including stature, resting pulse rate, gender, age, and lifestyles.
