The bible states that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. Faith then is the belief of something or someone without being able to see it. Many have described faith like the wind. Even though one cannot see the wind, one can feel the wind. One modern analogy of faith is that faith is like Wi-Fi, it is invisible but has the power to connect you to what you need. According to puritan ideology, faith is absolutely the absence of thought. The puritans knew that Godâ€™s ways were not their ways and neither their thoughts his thoughts. Faith was based off what they felt, or sense. Their faith was not based on critical thinking or even being able to explain how God made them feel. The way the Puritans came to know the divine will of God was not only to read the scriptures but to see how He was manifested in human history, current events, and natural phenomena. Even though God, like Wi-Fi, is invisible and sometimes one may not understand just how he works, he has the capability to get one connected to whatever is essential. According to those in the Enlightened Era, faith is not the absence of thought. The enlightened believed that faith and organized religion were useless as only the function of reason and the observation of the natural world were all that the Enlightened concluded was needed to know that a Creator existed. The Enlightened also deemed that the Creator was not involved in human everyday life. The answer to faith being the absence of thought lies in if one believes in the Creator with their heart or mind.
