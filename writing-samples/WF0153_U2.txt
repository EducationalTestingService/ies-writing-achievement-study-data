Abstract
The relationship between VC (L) and the other parameters such as height (cm), chest circumference (cm) and heart beats per minute (bpm) were investigated in the class of Principles of Biology students (n = 96) at a university. The students measured their heights, chest circumferences, and heart beats per minute. Pearson’s Correlation analysis indicated a significant relationship between VC and both height and chest circumference (p<0.05). However, there was no significant relationship between VC and heartbeats/min. As height and chest circumference increased, there was a corresponding significant increase in VC standing, suggesting that lung volume was directly related to the height and chest circumference. In contrast, the pulse rate was not related to the VC.


Introduction
It is known that vital capacity (VC) can be affected by the subject’s stature, age, gender, health status, and lifestyle, and also, due to its close relationship, VC can be considered as an indicator of body type (Pavlica et al., 2010). Furthermore, VC can affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in other words, considering VC is meaningful (Diaz, et al., 2000). VC may be defined as the volume of exhaled air from fully inflated lungs. The spirometer was invented by John Hutchinson in order to measure the VC (Petty, 2002). VC was found to be affected by sex, age, body size and physical condition. For example, the VC of adult females is usually 20 to 25% less than that of males. Tall people usually have a greater VC than short people, and thin people have a greater VC than obese people. Well-trained athletes can have a VC of 30 to 40% above that of untrained people (Seeley et al., 2008).

In this experiment, an investigation was done to determine if there was a relationship between the VC and other parameters such as height, chest circumference, and radial resting pulse rate. The objective of this study was to collect spirometry data from the students who take Principles of Biology, and they were investigated for factors affecting VC. The hypothesis was stated as there is a correlation between VC and the other parameters such as stature, heartbeats per minute, sex, age, and health status.

Materials and Methods
VC was measured in liters (L) by a group of University Principles of Biology students in laboratory sections L54, L55, L56 and 03C. The total number of students who participated in the spirometry study was 96, with 71 being females and 25 being males, ranging in age between 17 to 34 years old. Three replicates of VC were measured by each subject in the sitting and standing position, respectively. Also, the averages of VC were determined for both positions. 

The other three parameters chest circumferences (cm), height (cm) and resting pulse rate were measured by each subject. Chest circumference was measured using a tape measure and height was measured using a meter stick, respectively. Resting pulse rate was measured by placing the index and middle fingers of one hand on the radial artery of the other arm and counting the number of pulse beats in 15 seconds using a MyChron stopwatch. Three replicates of resting pulse rate were taken and the resting pulse rate per one-minute was determined by multiplying 4 by the average number of pulse beats in 15 seconds. Each student also recorded his or her age, sex, and whether he or she was a smoker or non-smoker, and whether he or she was an athlete or a non-athlete. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the data for any relationship between VC and their height, heartbeats per minute, and chest circumferences as a statistical analysis.

Result
Spirometry data for female (n=71, ages 17 to 24 years old) Principles of Biology students were variable (Table 1). Their average VC (standing) ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, with an overall average of 2.8 L, while their VC (sitting) ranged from 1.8 to 4.2 L, averaging 2.8 L (Table 1). Females ranged in height from 150 to 183 cm, averaging 164.9 cm, and their chest circumference (cm) ranged from a low of 67 cm to a high of 127 cm, averaging 87.5 cm (Table 1). The females’ average heartbeats per minute (bpm) ranged from 50.4 to 100 bpm, with an overall average of 76.5 bpm (Table 1). There were only 2 female smokers. Their average VC was 2.8 L while standing, and 2.8 L while sitting. For female nonsmokers (n=69), average VC (standing and sitting) ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 L, and from 1.8 to 4.2 L, respectively (Table 1). Their overall VC averages were 2.8 L (standing) and 2.8 L (sitting). For female athletes (n=24), average VC ranged from 2.0 to 3.9 L (standing), and 1.8 to 4.2 L (sitting), respectively. Overall averages of the female athletes’ VCs were 3.1 L (standing) and 2.8 L (sitting) (Table 1). For female non-athletes (n=47), average VC ranged from 1.8 to 3.8 L (standing), and 1.8 to 3.8 L (sitting), respectively. Their overall VC averages were 2.9 L (standing) and 2.9 (sitting) (Table 1).

In males (n = 25, ages 18 to 34 years old), VC (standing) ranged from 2.7 to 5.4 L, with an overall average of 4.4 L, while their sitting VC ranged from 2.8 to 5.2 L, with an overall average of 4.5 L (Table 2). They varied in height from 168 to 188.4 cm, showing an average height of 178.2 cm. Chest circumference (cm) in males ranged from 83 to 112 cm, averaging 98.6 cm, while their average heartbeats per minutes ranged from 56 to 93.3 bpm, showing an overall average of 73.5 bpm (Table 2). There were no male smokers. The nonsmoking males (n = 25), had an average VC (standing) that ranged from 2.7 L to 5.4 L, and from 2.8 L to 5.2 L (VC, sitting) (Table 2). Their overall average VCs were 4.4 L (standing) and 4.5 L (sitting). In male athletes (n = 13), the average standing and sitting VCs ranged from 2.7 to 5.4 L, and 2.8 to 5.2 L, respectively (Table 2). The overall average of VC for male non-athletes were 4.5 L (standing) and 4.5 L (sitting).

Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of height (cm) against VC standing (L) for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their heights from 150 to 188.4 cm. The scatter plot suggested a positive correlation, that is, as standing VC (L) increased, height (cm) also increased. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was significant relationship between standing VC (L) and heights (cm) because the calculated value (0.715) exceeded the tabulated value (0.201) at p = 0.05 (r = 0.715, n = 96, p = 0.05). The null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between height and VC (standing), was therefore rejected.

Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of heart beats /minutes against VC standing (L) for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their heart beats /minutes from 50.4 to 100. The scatter plot suggested no-correlation, that is, standing VC (L) does not affect the value of heart beats /minutes. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was no significant relationship between standing VC (L) and heart beats /minutes because the calculated value ( -0.124) did not exceed the tabulated value (0.201) at p = 0.05 (r = -0.124, n = 96, p = 0.05). The null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between heart beats /minutes and VC (standing), was therefore failed to be rejected.

Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of chest circumference (cm) against VC standing (L) for all 96 subjects. Their average VCs ranged from 1.8 to 5.4 L and their chest circumference from 67 to 127 cm. The scatter plot suggested a positive correlation, that is, as standing VC (L) increased, chest circumference (cm) also increased. Pearson’s Correlation coefficient analysis indicated that there was significant relationship between standing VC (L) and chest circumference (cm) because the calculated value (0.449) exceeded the tabulated value (0.201) at p = 0.05 (r = 0.449, n = 96, p = 0.05). The null hypothesis, which stated that there was no significant relationship between Chest Circumference and VC (standing), was therefore rejected.

Discussion
The VC is directly related to height based on the study by John Hutchinson (Petty, 2002). That is because lung volume tends to be larger as the height of the subject increases (Ota, 1959). Our results supported this expectation, because a significant correlation between VC standing and height were determined, that is, as height increased there was a corresponding significant increase in VC. Our results were explained by one possible explanation, that is, there is a positive correlation between height and lung capacity (Ota, 1959). Nevertheless, the way to measure lung capacity and air volume were varied depending on the researchers. Our suggestion for future studies is that the other measurements indicating lung volume should be used to examine its relation.

The data, which was about VC standing and heart beats /minutes, indicated that the pulse rate was not related to the VC standing. There was no significant correlation between VC standing and heart beats /minutes, that is, a correlation between VC standing and heart beats /minutes could not be found in the experiment. In terms of the heart failure, low VC is associated with development of congestive failure taking into account contributing influence including pulse rate (Kannel et al., 1974). It was possible that the other parameter such as smoking or athleticism could contribute to the relationship between VC standing and heart beats /minute. However, there were only 2 smokers in our experiments, that is, there were not enough data points to determine its relation. Also, the influence of postures on VC is examined in young people (Appel et al., 1986). Future studies should combine these factors, such as the condition of hearts or comparison of each posture.

The data, which was about VC standing and chest circumference, indicated that the chest circumference was related to the VC standing. Our results supported the expectation, because there was a significant correlation between VC standing and chest circumference, that is, as chest circumference increased there was corresponding significant increase in VC. The results were not explained by published finding, that is, the VC is not affected by chest circumference (Pavlica et al., 2010). The possible explanation was the differences between each sex. The VC is affected by the sex (Pavlica et al., 2010). The sex proportion of objects in our experiment was unbalanced (female = 71, male = 25). Our suggestion for future studies is that the data points should be collected much more and the data points from each parameter should be balanced.
