Applying to Work at the Home Depot



Mr. Lowe,

I am applying to be a part-time associate and/or cashier at your Anytown Home Depot. I am seeking this position because I am experienced in retail and highly-effective in customer-centered and fast-paced positions.

I have two years of experience in customer-service jobs in retail, fast-food, entertainment and stocking. These are all quick, team-oriented positions that I have mastered while working at these various jobs. It took communication, organization, and ability to fulfill tasks in a timely and efficient manner, and I’m hoping to bring what I have learned over to the Home Depot. I know a lot about tools and hardware as well, and if I don’t, I’m a fast learner. I have researched the company well, and I believe it to be a fulfilling retail experience that I can excel at while finishing my college career.

Hopefully I get to be a part of this great company; attached is my resume. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,


Sam Doe
