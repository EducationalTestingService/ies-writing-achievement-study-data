"On Being Brought from Africa to America”

In my opinion, On Being Brought from Africa to America created a reflective tone. Wheatley utilizes heroic couplets as well as Iambic Pentameter to illustrate her Godly experiences that she endured while she was being brought over from Africa. Wheatley states her soul was uneducated until she was brought to America. There she was taught that there is a God and she can confide in him. However, the white Christians believed that there was a difference between themselves and the African Americans. With that being said, there are many hidden images and meanings inside of her poem. For example, her reference to Cain, this biblical reference is used to illustrate that even African Americans as dark as Cain can access God if they do so wish. The word dark also contains multiple connotations. The obvious reverence is the skin tone. The other reference is about Cain himself. Cain killed his brother out of jealousy and wanted to be killed by others who knew what he had done. However, God placed a mark upon Cain and sent him out into the world where he would encounter terrible things. The mark that God placed on him was his skin color was no longer white. Wheatley’s underlying message is telling the Christians that no matter how dark a person is – skin tone or morally – may change their ways in order to be with God in the promise land. There is salvation for everyone regardless of what they may look like on the outside. God judges man by what is on the inside of the man’s heart.
