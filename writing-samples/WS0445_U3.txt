Topic Interests: 

I have chosen topic number 1 for my essay prompt 

I am interested in this topic for a few reasons. One, because as soon as I started reading the prompt and saw the term informed consent which is a term that I’m currently learning in psychology so it’s a word that I’ve studied before. The second reason is because after reading all the other prompts, I had more in mind that I could elaborate on for prompt 1 than 2 and 3.



Research Procedures:

For my essay I need to pursue the benefits (if there were any) of the African American patients who got used for medical research without consent from them.

If I want to find factual evidence on my research topic other than the library and the internet I could go to a hospital, to a science laboratory, or even a black history museum to see factual evidence of what happened to those African American patience.





The purpose of this essay is to explain that the use of medical research on subjects that did not give their approval is inappropriate and wrong.

The use of patients and medical subjects is inappropriate despite the benefits it has brought because it is villainy, untrustworthy, and illegal.
