Who Are You?
My name is Sam Doe and I am a freshman here at this university.  I have two brothers: one twin brother that also attends my university and dorms with me, and my older brother who is a college graduate with a master’s degree in criminal justice.  My parents were both born in Colombia and moved here at a very young age by themselves, and I am proud to mention that they learned how to speak English completely on their own by simply listening to people passing by on the streets.  I also have the most amazing pup in the world and she really is a tremendous part of  my life.  The main reason I’m in college is so that I can make my parents proud by at least graduating with a bachelor's as they were never able to do so themselves.  My older brother was the first person in my entire family to graduate college and I plan on following his footsteps.  I like playing soccer for fun, weight lifting, and meeting new people; although it can be hard for me sometimes because I’m a bit reserved and introverted.  I do genuinely enjoy math and plan on getting a career as an applied mathematician, but that can possibly change throughout the semester.  I am a very laid back person as I’m usually not bothered by much, and I am a very good listener and love helping people to the best of my ability.  I hope to be able to travel around the world with some of my closest friends.  I love learning about different cultures, religions, and social lives.  I plan on living in some countries for a few years at a time to really absorb the culture.  Oh and how could I forget, the FOOD!!
