One of my favorite authors that we studied in this course would be Phillis Wheatley.

The reason I admire her as a writer is because she did something that no one thought was possible. She was a female slave who was taught how to read and write at a young age. She surpassed all expectations and became a renowned published poet. She was a role model for both women and people of color. Her work shows that anyone can do what they set their mind to.
