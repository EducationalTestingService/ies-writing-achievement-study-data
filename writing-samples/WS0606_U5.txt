Google Making Us Stupid 

Is mostly based in how the internet work in our brains, the internet now have different platforms that work in all the new technology. Everyone seems happy with the new Iphone or Samsung Galaxy because they want to post a new and nice picture. However between  pictures became a trend Google is always on the top, because almost every person that uses the internet know about this search engine. 

But Google is making us stupid? The author Nicholas Carr states; “For me, as for others, the Net is becoming a universal medium, the conduit for most of the information that flows through my eyes and ears and into my mind. The advantages of having immediate access to such an incredibly rich store of information are many, and they’ve been widely described and duly applauded.” 

The quotation is supporting my view in how Google is being helpful for this generation, because  in the media is any type of information. Good and bad. Is the user's discretion how they want to process the information obtained from the media.
