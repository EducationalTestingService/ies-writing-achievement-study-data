Social Media 
	Facebook has become one of the main attractions when it comes to the social media world. In “Facebook Is Using You”, Lori Andrews explains how it now is more harmful than it ever was before. Facebook and many other social media sites are now using and sending out information that is way too invasive, could stop people from receiving necessities, and prevent them from getting good jobs. 
	Facebook now has extra information on users that the users do not know about. This extra information includes tax information and different family relationships. Facebook and other social media networks are even going as far as checking what people search over the web. They then take this information and create ads specific to what was searched for. 
	Credit card and insurance companies have also been cracking down on who they will do business with simply because of what they have searched for online. Lori Andrews explained how a man’s credit card limit was lowered just because of what he had looked up online. Insurance is needed to live in todays society, but companies are now checking online before giving it out. 
	Before anyone gets a job, there is a good chance employers checked their social media accounts. The information they are likely to find could prevent people from receiving work. Many companies have stated that they have not hired someone because of the information they found online. 
	Social media outlets are now becoming unsafe for many people. The information that can be found on them is unfair because it can now be used to their disadvantage. Laws should be put into place that regulate what information online sites can and cannot use.
