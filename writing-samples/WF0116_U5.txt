I remember that hot, Tuesday morning of November as if it was yesterday. I was sitting in the guidance office, waiting for Mrs. Smith to come and help me get situated. I had just turned 15 a few months back and moved to Anytown. I was the new girl in town and I could not speak English. Of course, I knew the basics, like “hello” and “how are you,” but I could not maintain a conversation, even if I understood a little. It was terrifying! I felt like a fish out of the water; like a drop of oil in a glass full of water. I was hoping for someone to save me, guide me even, with this new transition. However, I did not imagine that it would not go well. Soon, I understood the reason why friends and success cannot mix together.
In less than a year, my lips would easily pronounce words that, for a long time, would have been foreign to my ears. My eyes would devour whatever they could find written in a piece of paper with the help of my hands. And my ears will enjoy the echo of words like milk and honey. Though, my journey was not easy. I remember the days I would tell my mother crying, “I can’t anymore. I want to go back home!” and she would embrace me in a big, warm hug while my tears damped her blouse. She reminded me every day that I could not stop; that I had not come this far to give up and leave everything behind; that every tear, every smile, every little thing I accomplished, would be something I would be proud of one day. It became true. I graduated from high school with honors and soon became an example for other kids with a similar background like me. All of that was accomplished because that language barrier that once held me back, is now a bridge; a bridge I built when the barrier collapsed.
