Introduction
In Spirometry studies, many researchers have discussed how vital capacity (VC) may be influenced by height, gender, age, health status, and lifestyle choices. As described by Seeley et al., 2008, spirometry is the process of measuring volumes of air that move into and out of the respiratory system, and VC is the maximum volume of air exhaled from the respiratory tract after maximum inhalation. In 1846, John Hutchinson, who invented the first wet spirometer, indicated that measuring one's VC can help with the prediction of premature mortality (Petty, 2002). Hutchinson also measured the VC of 2,130 individuals and showed a relationship between VC and pulmonary diseases (Hutchinson, 1846). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) affect respiratory functions and diminish a person’s VC. Spirometry can be used to predict the progression of COPD and DMD based on a person’s VC after a baseline has been established (Phillips et al., 2001, Petty, 2002). In longitudinal studies it has also been reported that diminishing VC is more pronounced in smokers compared to nonsmokers (Bande, 1978). Besides disease and smoking, VC has also been recorded to be affected by height, gender, age, health status, and other lifestyle choices (Petty, 2002).

The purpose of this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between VC and other parameters such as height, age, radial resting pulse rate, gender, age, and lifestyle choices. The objective of this study was to collect spirometry data from college students, which would be scrutinized for factors affecting VC. The hypothesis tested is that VC correlated with the other parameters including height, age, radial resting pulse rate, gender, age, and lifestyle choices.
