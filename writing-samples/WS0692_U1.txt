As Puritans, we have to abide by the Divine Laws. There is no reason for us to think and question the rules because following those rules is what makes us who we are. A devout Puritan, such as myself, does not question the Divine Laws and must follow them blindly to assure our salvation.  We cannot waste our time trying to figure out if following those rules is something we want to do, following those rules is something we have to do.  One of the most important parts of our religion is being completely submissive to the Divine Law to guarantee our place in the next life because there is no man who can assure our place for us. So, for a devout Puritan, faith would be considered an absence of thought. However, this does not mean we are mindless, another part of being a devout Puritan is studying natural phenomena, history, and current events.

As a devout intellectual from the Enlightened era, I believe that faith is not an absence of thought. We have faith but not in God. We have faith in our minds. We think rationally when making decisions. We do not blindly submerge ourselves into the Divine Law like the Puritans. We use reasoning and science to make our decisions. We never jump into anything mindlessly without doing research and using our minds. We have faith in what we can see and understand, not something that cannot be seen or heard.
