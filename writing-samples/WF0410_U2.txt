The concept of honesty is something that is easy to explain but hard to really follow through on.
  Honesty is to tell the truth no matter what even if it is small or big and you accept the 
consequence that comes with it. For Example if you’re at college and you’re staying up late with 
our friends and your mom call you telling not to stay up late. Then you tell her you won’t but 
you go to sleep at 4 am and you over sleep your 9 a.m. class. No you have to explain to your
 mom why you missed that class and you have to tell her the truth. Another example of being 
honest is when you tell your friend you broke there video game. This is the concept of honesty 
tell the truth no matter what.
