Sam Doe Intro

My name is Sam Doe and I am a Finance Major. My goal in this course is to learn about proper business etiquette and to hopefully gain a better understand of the way individuals in business communicate and assert themselves. I hope to improve through this course my ability to assert myself in a strong yet non-threatening way and better learn how to talk to my peers and people around me when working together on a project. I hope to improve my leadership skills and also my organizational skills so that if I ever own or work in a business one day I can efficiently do my job and lead others below me without too much resistance. I think communication is important for anyone working in Finance. A job in Finance may require you to make important decisions on budgeting and saving that conflict with how normal operations in the company usually go. Being able to communicate the importance of your decisions and also communicating how you arrived at those decisions to someone who is resistant to new changes is an important task that will be very beneficial in a field like Finance. I think business communication is very important when also searching for a job. Interviews require that the person hiring you makes a decision about how well you will work based on how well you present yourself, both on paper and off. If you present yourself well on paper, but speak very softly or act unapproachable off paper, you may lose the position you originally would have received to the well-spoken and articulate person who comes in after you with a slightly less impressive resume. In this class I hope to learn how to articulate myself in a way that stands out to employers and makes a statement about my work ethic. This type of business etiquette is important and I think paying attention to your presentation could mean the difference between a good job and a great job.
