Blackish “Juneteenth” Episode Summary
     In Blackish’s “Juneteenth” episode, the need to celebrate June 19th 1865 was expressed through songs, stories, and justifications after seeing a children’s play. The spark of the need to celebrate June 19th arose from a misrepresentation of Christopher Colombus’ “founding” of America from Diane and Jack’s school play. When it was known that in reality Christopher Columbus was a slave trader, this made Andre want to express the truth. Through song the story of the abolition of slavery came to life through the episode. There was a conflict, however, based on the need and want for the official celebration of June 19th to be treated as a holiday. Some people, generally outside of the minorities, didn’t necessarily want to celebrate something that they didn’t want to admit happened, as mentioned by one of Andre’s co-workers. They had the general mindset of what happened in the past should stay in the past.
