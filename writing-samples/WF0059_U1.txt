Purple Hibiscus Essay A
		
			The author of “Purple Hibiscus” Chimamanda Ngozi would use different aspects of nature such as plants, insects, and weather as a comparison to Kambili surroundings as well as her view on her love ones.

		Chimamanda would even use one aspect of nature to represent the title of her novel “Purple Hibiscus” to a rare flower that symbolizes freedom. The purple hibiscus flower was grown by Aunty Ifeoma and considered to be spontaneously beautiful and creative. The flower would also symbolize the rigid life between Jaja and Kambili. The author would make this comparison of both Kambili and Jaja as a way of self and possibility.

		Throughout the novel, Kambili would use different aspects of nature in comparison to her family and her environment. Kambili would describe her internal conflict and enjoyment she has to deal with her family and personal life. Kambili mentions when “Ade Coker dies it would come as a heavy rain fall” which would come as a sad and depressing result to her emotions. Even after Papa threw the missal at Jaja, she would describe it as a “strong wind uprooting the frangipani trees and the satellite dish”

	Even during the novel, Kambili would begin to mature as she grew older.  Kambili would later adapt to things that use to scare her for instants, the worms in Aunty Ifeoma’s bath. This would change her whole outlook on nature to a much sophisticated view. As a result, it would allow a shift in view of nature causing her to have a much calmer sense of mind.

	Overall, the narrator uses different aspects of nature such as plants, insects, and weather as a comparison to her surroundings. These aspects help play a role in Kambili personal life causing her to use them to describe her inner conflict and emotional state with her love ones. This was an outlook for the audience to relate to common interchanges natures and other aspects have on ones mindset
