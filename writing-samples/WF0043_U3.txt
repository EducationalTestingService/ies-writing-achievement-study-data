Dear Ms. Smith:

As a rising junior at the university majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in International Business, I learned about the sales internship for the summer of 2018 available at Gartner from the University career centerâ€™s SeaWork system. After reading the description of the program I am very interested in the position because of the hands-on experience incorporated through the program. 

I am a highly motivated individual who is looking for a fast-paced environment with many learning opportunities that can lead to high achievement in sales. Since I am driven and motivated by achievement I am disciplined and analytical in my work. I am interested in Gartner because of your unbiased opinion on research leading to a more proactive decision for clients. 

I am looking forward to speaking with you about how my educational and work background will reflect nicely within the Sales internship program and how I can become a tool for your organization. I have attached my resume to this letter, and my phone number is 555-555-5555 or email address is samdoe@uni.edu. Thank you for considering my application. 


Sincerely, Sam Doe
