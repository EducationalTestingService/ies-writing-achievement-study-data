Todays political climate is it helping or hurting?
	President Donald trump made his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” but is he helping or hurting. This policy will hurt people of color the most because it will cut programs that a lot of the community uses. The current political climate has been very stressful for many since president trump ha been elected. Democrats were more likely stressed than republican. There are a lot of uncertainties in todays political climate. This stems from the uncertainties some of the recent things that have been taking place. People of color will have no economic standing in the future because of the political climate we are currently in which may cause loss of education, many people with be at risk for health problems, and some will lose their homes.
People of color when it comes t education always get the shorter end of the stick. The us political climate also has to do with potential budget cuts. There are some targeted budget reductions that will impact people of color if passed by congress. President trump plans to cut 9 billion dollars from budget, while increasing investment in school choice programs. This will push districts to attach funding to individual students, if a student leaves a public school that school will see a decrease in funding. This will negatively impact students of color in terms of academic achievement and segregation. 61.9 percent of black students use a pell grant. If the bill is passed 3.9 billion dollars will be canceled, that means 61.9 percent of those students will be out of money. Today’s us climate is a fearful time for those in the department of education especially those effected.
