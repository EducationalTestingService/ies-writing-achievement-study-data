Materials and Methods
        	The spirometry lab that was performed allowed the groups of University Principles of Biology, laboratory sections L54, L55, L56 and 03A students to determine the vital capacity of the lungs. Vital capacity is the maximum volume of the air that a person can exhale after maximum inhalation. When VC is measured it is calculated by liters (L). The total number of students that participated was 96, and there were a total of 71 females and 25 males. Their ages ranged from 17 to 34 years old. During the experiment, the students had to use the Phipps and Bird 9-Liter Wet Spirometer to measure the vital capacity. The students had to blow into the tube while sitting for three trials and standing for three trials. After the number was recorded for each trial the students had to align the Phipps and Bird 9-Liter Wet Spirometer back to zero to get a new calculation and the correct values needed. After the trials were recorded the numbers need to be added up and divided by 3 to find the average.
        	The factors that could affect the vital capacity are measurements of chest circumference, height, and pulse rate were taken. To measure the chest, the tape measurer was used to put around the person's chest and recorded in the unit of centimeters. Height was also measured by a meter stick and recorded in centimeters. After being rested for 10 minutes, the pulse rate was done by placing two fingers, middle and index, to place on the radial artery of the arm. Once the pulse is found, time using the Mychron stop watch allowed for the counting of beats in 15 seconds and recorded on a piece of paper. This process was repeated 2 more times. By finding the average of the numbers and multiplying it by 4, which will allow you to determine the beats per minute. The other information that was recorded was the age, gender, athletic or not, and if the student was a smoker or not.
