What Is Love and What It Is Not?

	Love is not physical abuse, verbal abuse, or emotional abuse. Someone who beats you, makes derogatory comments, or even controls you does not love you. Love is the feeling you get when someone makes you feel good and you could not imagine life without them, they fill your heart and mind with joy because of the positive uplifting things they tell and do for you. Love is someone believing in you, being patient with you and respecting you. For example, someone who loves you will show it by listening to you, hearing you out when you are trying to communicate. Love is not controlling behavior for instance, someone who says you cannot leave the house or communicate with your family because they said so. Undeniably love is knowing when you have been through enough, self-love.
