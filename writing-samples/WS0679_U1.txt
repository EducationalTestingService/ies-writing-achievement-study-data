Many adults say social networking  has eliminated social lives of young people today. Though young people spend much time on apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, and  Twitter, they are still considered a part of their social life.
	
	Dating is one concept that has changed abruptly along with technology. Today’s parents,  that say social networks are bad, did not have the advantage to direct message anyone on Instagram. With no apps or internet, they had limited dating options, like only being able to meet people that they happen to see through out the day. A big trend in social media right now is dating apps. Dating apps allow you a wide spread selection of people in your area looking for a partner. These apps make it more convenient to meet people and find a match for yourself faster than they would without the help of a dating app. 

 	Friendship is also easier to come by with the development of social media. Instagram for example, is a place to post pictures and more importantly, express yourself. Instagram makes it easy to find people who have the same interest as you using relatable pictures and hashtags, and also makes it easier to contact those people.

	Not only can you find friendship on social media, but you can also keep up with friends you do not get to see often. A quick message to a long distance friend can keep a relationship going that might have ended without the invention of social media. Young people still have their social lives in school, out of school, from work, and more. If anything, social media has added to our social lives and enhanced our relationships with people more than ever before.
