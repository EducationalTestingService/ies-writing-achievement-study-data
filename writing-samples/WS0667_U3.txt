Poetry writing is a wonderful tool that can be used for strengthening writing skills. Through poetry writing, we gain more knowledge of language, cultivate a robust vocabulary, master literary devices, and learn to work in imagery. Poetry is an art and craft of its own kind. Poetry can be written in prose form. Prose poems are a hybrid genre of writing and it uses various poetry techniques.

Poetry is greatly influenced by use of imagery; however, prose regularly focuses on aspects such as narrative and characters. Prose is anything written down that does not possess any poetry meter. The poetic meter is the rhythm of a poem. Rhythm is based on a variety of factors, and they include the syllables per line and what syllables are emphasized. Poetry is rhythmic and image-based whereas prose contains narrative and does not follow any set rhythm. 

Poetry is mainly used in expressing something or a feeling in an artistic way. Prose in comparison to poetry is typically straightforward and without much decoration. Poetry uses lines that may not be arranged in sentences. This is not the case with prose. Prose use sentences to bring out ideas and these sentences are arranged in paragraphs. 

Prose uses the traditional way of writing sentences. In prose the first letter in each sentence is capitalized. If this scenario is compared to poetry there seems to be a slight disparity. Modern poetry chooses not to adhere to this rule therefore in some poems the first letter in a line may be a small letter.  

Prose and poetry are closely related however they bear slight differences. These differences come about from the use of imagery in poems whereas prose mainly focusing on aspects. The sentencing of prose and use of lines in poetry all contribute to the difference between prose and poetry.
