In   the   book   “Purple   Hibiscus”   by   Chimamanda   Adiche   there   is   a   lot   of   conflict   and   obligation between   Kambili’s   family   and   her   father.   Kambili   lives   with   her   parents   and   brother   Jaja. Everyone   in   the   house   is   struggling   to   give   Papa   what   he   aspects   of   them.   For   example,   Jaja did   not   do   communion   one   day   and   his   father   was   very   disappointed.   This   created   conflict between   them   two   and   made   Jaja   be   very   resentful   to   his   father   for   an   amount   of   time.   Also   the Papa   wants   more   children(mainly   boys)   but   it   is   very   hard   for   the   mother   to   have   one   because she   has   lost   a   good   amount   of   children   and   recently   had   a   miscarriage.   Papa   doesn’t   really show   that   he’s   mad   but   he   doesn’t   like   that   she   can’t   have   any.   Lastly   Kambili   who   is   the   main character   is   in   school   that   her   father   pays   for   and   he   expects   her   to   be   first   in   her   class   in   terms of   grades   but   she   places   second.   This   creates   conflict   because   Kambili   is   scared   to   tell   her father   because   she   know   she   disappointed   him   and   he   will   a   big   deal   about   it.   Papa   is   a   very expectant   person   and   he   wants   the   best   of   everything   for   his   family   and   wants   them   to   be perfect.
