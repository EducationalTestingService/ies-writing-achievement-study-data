Scenario 1

	The question of, “Is faith an absence of thought” is very disturbing. I believe this to be utterly untrue. To question faith is equivalent to questioning God himself. There are many people that have begun to question faith.  These people are straying from their faith and being unfaithful to God. Faith is something that you should be able to feel. Religion in general is something that you should be able to feel its effects. A true puritan never questions God. Faith is centered around having full faith and feeling the effects of the almighty God.  There are many threats against our religion as it is. There is no need for any ore to come from all of these questions involving faith. A true puritan would never ask if faith was an absent of thought. 

Scenario 2

	The question of, “Is faith an absence of thought” is necessary to ask.  The Enlightenment era sheds light on how all things should be questioned. Faith is part of these things that we should question. When people use their minds it often results in a good degree of success. There are many conflicting ideas and studies that contradict the original puritan beliefs. Puritans have a set forth belief that people can actually feel faith. This has been very hard to prove and I believe it to be impossible. In a sense, faith holds people back from truly thinking and making advancements in society. There are many studies that support this idea. Faith is one of the main things that hinder and hold people back from truly using their minds.
