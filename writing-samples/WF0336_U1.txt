Black Men and Public Space
	Without doing much , the average black man is able to make the majority feel uneasy merely at the sight of him. Whether we’d like to believe it or not, we have been conditioned to view black males as almost beast like. They are portrayed more aggressively in the media and their mass presence in the national prison population seems to support these inhumane claims. Men like Brent Staples, a journalist that graduated from the University of Chicago with his P.H.D., have to take extreme measures in order not to be associated with the violent stigma that seems to plague black men. Staples stated that he learned to “take precautions to make myself less threatening”. In order to make those around him comfortable , he even began to whistle Beethoven melodies to give the impression that he was peaceful. While I do think it is ridiculous for black men to have to take such extreme measures to seem harmless, I also believe it was needed to ensure his own safety. Once while simply rushing into his own office, he was mistaken for a burglar by the office manager. Lately in society if you seem even the slightest bit dangerous without even doing any wrong, you still can be hurt or killed. By Brent Staples adopting strategies to make those around him feel comfortable, he is possibly preventing a future dispute that could have been avoided simply if those around him were not predisposed to fear the black man.
