Introduction
It is known that vital capacity (VC) can be changed depending on the subjectâ€™s stature, age, gender, health status and lifestyle. VC may be defined as the volume of exhaled air from fully inflated lungs (Petty, 2002). The spirometer was invented by John Hutchinson in order to measure the VC (Petty, 2002). VC was found to be affected by sex, age, body size and physical conditioning. For example, the VC of adult females is usually 20 to 25% less than that of males. Tall people usually have a greater VC than short people, and thin people have a greater VC than obese people. Well-trained athletes can have a VC of 30 to 40% above that of untrained people (Seeley et al., 2008)

In this experiment, an investigation was done to determine if there was a relationship between the VC and other parameters such as height, chest circumference and radial resting pulse rate, following instructions provided in the handout (Forbes, 2017). The objective of this study was to collect spirometry data from the students who take Principles of Biology, and they were investigated for factors affecting VC. The hypothesis is that there is a correlation between VC and the other parameters such as stature, heartbeats per minute, sex, age and health status.
