Mrs. Mary Humiston
Human Resources Director
Rolls Royce North America
1865 Explorer St, Suite 200
Reston, VA 20190

Dear Mrs. Humiston,

After seeing the open Operations Management Summer Internship, reference #00086567, on the corporate website, I am enthusiastically submitting my résumé. As a supply chain management major at University, I believe this opportunity will provide me with invaluable hands-on experience. At the same time, I am confident that I can also provide value to Rolls Royce in this position, as I excel at creative problem solving, analytical thinking, and team work. 

My logic based background in supply chain management and mathematics provides me with the perfect skill set to excel as an operations intern at Rolls Royce. I am quick to learn and adapt, proficient at understanding complex systems, and diligent in my work. In addition, my ability to communicate and coordinate with my peers is proven through my experience as a professional Realtor. My academic record reflects my strong motivation and determination, and I hope to apply that work ethic as an intern at your company. 

I appreciate the opportunity to be considered for this position and greatly anticipate hearing feedback from the hiring committee. I’ve attached my résumé for review and my contact information at the top of this letter in case there are any further questions or concerns that I may address. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,




Sam Doe
