	During the post World War II women roles and expectations in society were changing rapidly. Previously most women were known to stay at home as house wives, raise and teach their children, and were expected to maintain lady like behavior. In the movie “Mudbound” despite the racial barriers in the community both wives Florence Jackson and Laura McAllan obey their husbands, helped out their family in times of need and were the center of webs in their community.  

	When Henry McAllan made the decision that his family moved from their comfortable suburban life and relocating to the farmland in the rural Laura accept even though that is not the life she chose. Also, Florence Jackson make sure she keeps her family together as was expected of her. 

	Women in the 1930s came up with remarkable ways to keep their families afloat during this era. They helped their families get by on less and maximized every opportunity to save money. For example Florence Jackson accepts to work as a nanny for the McAllans and Laura McAllan kept secrets just so that her family do not go apart. 

	Also, both wives serve as a mother to all in the community. People in the community look up to them as role models and their doors were always open to the community.

	In conclusion, during that time period it was really hard for women to stand out for themselves because of society perceives them to be modest and poise even in difficult situations. However, many things have changed from then to now. For example, before they weren’t allowed to work if they were married but now women can.
