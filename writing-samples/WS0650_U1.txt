Faith is the complete trust in someone or something. Thought is an idea or opinion produced by thinking or occurring suddenly in the mind. As a devout Puritan, I would say that faith is an absent of thought. I say this because, no one can affect their own salvation. The only person that has the privilege to affect anyone’s salvation is God. Since thought is someone’s idea or opinion I believe that faith should not be associated with thought. I think if you are thinking of different opinions and ideas about the bible and god suddenly, then you are not a true devout puritan. I think for someone to be a very well-rounded person, they should read the bible and naturally occurring events. As puritans, we are very specific in what we believe. I believe that opinions and other ideas that’s not the bible shouldn’t be compared to faith.

As an intellectual of the enlightenment era, I believe that faith isn’t an absence of thought. Thought is ideas or opinions that occur suddenly in the mind. Enlightenment intellectuals have multiple opinions and ideas. We believe in mans mind not Gods words. We also believe in how science advances and faith recedes. Its not the fact that we don’t believe in god, we just don’t think that god is the focus in life. We let people have their own opinions and thought about things. We believe in how perfect man can be. We do put our trust in somethings, but we also put our own ideas and opinions into account.
