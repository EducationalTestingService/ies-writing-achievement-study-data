Essay Thesis Statements and Outlines

Topic: Altering Public Space, Brent Staples "Black Men and Public Space":
Thesis Statement: People can change the mood of a public space based off of who they are or the people that are around, and they can change it in a positive or negative way.
 
Outline:
Intro:
Many times, a public mood is changed amongst people because of the race of an individual/group; mainly POC
Can change for the better or the worse
Ex: Black family in a PWN (predominantly white neighborhood) and thinking they're troublemakers, Arab/Muslim in airports/on a plane and assuming they're terrorists, seeing a Latinx family and assuming they're undocumented, etc
Staples talks about a white woman thinking of him in negative ways when they were both just innocently walking down the street
She perceived him in that way because he's black
Sometimes a person's gender can change public space mood
Ex: a woman/small group of women in a predominantly male work place
This is mainly based on stereotypes or cultural/gender bias
P. 1:
This situation happens with/against any race; not just white vs POC
POC stereotype other POC; even inside of their own cultural community
Many times, a person feels entitled to judge because of their job position
Ex: black mall security guard seeing a group of black kids and jumps to assuming they're going to start trouble; actuality: they're there to shop/spend time together, etc; he's judging off of the stereotype "all black people start trouble"
He's judging within his own racial community
P. 2:
Common personal experience: being "followed" around a clothing store
Happens LITERALLY all the time
Sales associate/security guard intentionally following me around when I'm shopping, thinking I'm stealing
I feel uncomfortable, therefore I leave with nothing; that action probably fitting their assumptions, when it's false
I leave with nothing because I feel uncomfortable being followed while I shop; they think I'm stealing so they follow me to make sure I leave with nothing
They're going to continue this stereotypical belief with the next person and so on
P. 3: 
Many situations where these assumptions end in tragedy; particularly: unarmed black man vs white cop
Possible ending situation: death
"Where fear and weapons meet- and they often do in urban America- there is always the possibility of death"- Staples 
Ex: Trayvon Martin; prime example (Feb. 26, 2012)
Young black boy (17 yrs old) just walking home from a convenient store with candy and a drink (skittles and iced tea)
George Zimmerman: neighborhood watch volunteer; not even a cop; assumed Trayvon as a mugger; shot and killed him; "it was self-defense"; still walks free to this day
He assumed the worst of Trayvon because of his size (5'11), what he was wearing (a hoodie) and it was at night so he couldnâ€™t see his face
Stereotypical assumption: black mugger intending harm; Actuality: black male walking home from a store with snacks and a drink 
Now dead because of another's racist assumptions
Many more stories before and following this stemming from the same problem: stereotypical assumptions 
Conclusion:
A person's assumptions can do a lot of things: a positive impact or a lot of damage
Situation does go both ways: a person's assumptions and a person's actions
An individual can positively or negatively alter public space
BUT public space is only altered/changed based off of another's assumptions
