ETS Assessment Assignment

Scenario 1:

	Faith is not an absence of thought, but rather the result of thought, as well as working to compliment the thought so as to better understand and be devoted to god. Faith is an essential part to any individualâ€™s relationship to god, that while does not necessarily require thought is also certainly not an absence of thought. In fact, often it is thought itself that creates that faith, as some require logical reasons to have faith, however once they think they arrive at faith, and their faith is only stronger for it. In this instance thought not only serves to create faith but also strengthens said faith.



Scenario 2:

	Faith is indeed precisely a lack of thought. One only requires faith if they have a lack of thought, as thought can lead one to God just as easily and readily as faith and create just as strong a relationship with God. Faith is nothing but a cheap, easily acquired and easily faked version of a true, meaningful relationship with God which can only be supported and maintained by a thorough intellectual understanding of God and his relationship with man. Faith, like emotion, has always come easily to man and is often found to be misplaced or altogether wrong. Thought however is a faculty that has rarely failed man and has in fact advanced man in many ways not only religiously but in every aspect of life. Faith is a shallow, easily acquired relationship with god, while thought can only lead to a deep, thorough, and intimate relationship with God.
