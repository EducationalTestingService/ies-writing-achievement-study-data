Everyday black people like Staples and I are continually accused and judged for crimes that never take place. Everything we do is considered suspicious even, if its regular everyday things like taking a long night stroll. We are seen as disturbances and problems to the world around us.  Unfortunately, this treatment has continued to happen and can be seen in the lives of black people today like me. Just like Staples I have felt that I have been unfairly judged and altered public space when I walk down the street, or enter a store, or approach someone.

When I walk down the street people assume I'm a threat to them. One time I was walking on a side walk and I noticed this white women walking in front of me. A second later, she turned around and saw me. Her expression looked as if she was frightened by my presence. She then proceed to clutch her handbag as if I was going to rob her. Then I experience a similar situation as Staples. She started to walk and crossed the road to the other side of the street. I was confused and a little upset that I altered public space by just walking down the street. Which brings me to a related incident: when I was walking down the street tot go to the store.

Entering a store in the night makes people suspicious and anxious of me stealing from them. When I finally got to the store I was met with beady hawk eyes. The cashier was watching me as if I was committing a crime by walking in. I then proceeded to browse the aisles for a snack. But then I noticed that one of the employees seemed to be following me around the store. As he was checking to make sure I wasn't stealing. Then when I went up to the cash register I didn't receive the greeting on everyone else did.
