Is faith an absence of thought? Faith isn’t a thought or something that is made up in the brain. Faith is a mental feeling, there are no words to describe any kind of physical feeling to explain it. Enlightenment ideas are not the only kind of thoughts that are inquisitive, Puritans can have deep interesting thoughts as well. Enlightenment intellectuals believe that everything in life has some sort of explanation and answer, but some things are better left unexplained. God makes miracles happen, and miracles cannot be explained by any amount of thought processes by enlightenment intellectuals. Faith is separate from thought so one can contain both, so faith is not defined as the absence of thought.

Is faith an absence of thought? Faith is the absence of thought because thought provides the clarity to realize that faith and God cannot be proven by physical facts. The only things that are real are the physical things that we can study and explain. Puritans believe in God’s miracles on Earth, but miracles are just illusions of the mind. There is no logical reason behind having so much faith and time investment in something one cannot see. Puritans claim to not be able to see God, but they can see the effects and they can feel their faith. Faith is a weakness. It shows ignorance, because they are not really intelligent to see the reasoning behind not having faith. Faith is not backed up with reason, so faith is the absence of thought.
