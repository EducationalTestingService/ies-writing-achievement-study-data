Introduction
Vital capacity (VC) has been studied various times by scientists all over the world to try and understand the intricacies of how disease and other factors can interfere with the compliance of the lungs. Vital capacity is defined as the maximum volume of air that a person can expel from the respiratory tract after a maximum inspiration, McGraw Hill, 2008, and is measured with a device known as a spirometer. The spirometer was first invented by John Hutchinson in the 1800’s and is still widely used today to measure VC in the medical and research field (Petty, 2002). As mentioned previously spirometry has a correlation to disease, and is often used to diagnose and track the progress of recovery from various diseases. These diseases include lung cancer and heart attacks, especially in smokers which is why diagnosing using spirometry is important for people at risk of these diseases (P. Enright 2005). VC is most times tested in older patients, but with more recent studies young adults have focused on testing young adults and conditioning them with different elements (C.S Kim, 2011).
The research done by the students of university biology lab sections shows a study focused on young adults with various backgrounds and similar ages to further understand VC in young subjects. Each student has their own unique background which includes some variables that were accounted for, such as athleticism, that can affect VC throughout the years. By relating this to other studies by adding on to others hypothesis by asking similar questions and looking for similar findings. This study was done to test the hypothesis that a person’s stature, radial resting heart rate, or lifestyle is correlated to their VC.
