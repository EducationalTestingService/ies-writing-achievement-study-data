Use of Social Media 

	A long road filled with dark, seemingly empty houses. Imagine the only kind of social life someone has comes through a computer or cell phone. Social media sights are becoming increasingly popular in today’s age. Also more and more people are spending time on these sights, rather than having real life interactions. Social networking sights such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter could quiet possibly be damaging today’s youth. Using such sights could lead students to not developing good social skills. 

	Having a good social life makes nearly everything better. Being social in school means having more friends. Being social at work means possibly getting a promotion, or at least making it more fun. Taking the time to have face to face interactions with someone is a lot more meaningful than sending a text. Also more interactions will help you gain social cues, or have a better understanding of context. 

	Spending small amounts of time on social websites is not a bad thing. Actually, it will expand your social life, and give an edge on technology. However this cannot replace a real social life. Someone could suffer from things such as autism, or social anxiety, which would lead them away from real life interactions. Not having a social life could make the number of individuals diagnosed with autism even greater. 

	In order for people to change the way society looks at social media, people must lessen their use of it. Eventually children are going to no longer play outside. Instead they will stay inside on a computer. This could lead to an alarming rate of childhood obesity or other health concerns. 

	In conclusion social media can be a powerful and useful tool, but if people allow it to control their lives, it could alter the way people socialize. A little goes a long way. Go out, have fun, and meet new people.
