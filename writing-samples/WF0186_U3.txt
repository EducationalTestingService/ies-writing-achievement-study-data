RE: Computer & Information Systems Associate 

I am writing to apply for the position of Computer & Information Systems Associate at One Source Communications that was posted on indeed.com. I am confident that my skills are well-aligned with the role, and that I would be an excellent fit for your organization.


Studying Information Systems and Business administration at the University has given me deep insight on technology and a varied skill-set that includes knowledge of Microsoft Office. Having worked with servers and windows with various different program applications I think these skills would make me a valuable asset to One Source Communications.

My experiences and track record make me an excellent fit for this opportunity. I have enclosed my resume for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email at a time of your convenience to discuss my background as well as the requirements for the role. Thank you for the opportunity. 

Sincerely,
